  <content contentuid="h95260213g74e3g462fgbd37g1c4f376e1819" version="2">But what do I get for all my hard work? A pat on the head and vinegar for wine.</content>

  <content contentuid="hdaf095c0g131eg4579gb139g95f1ebc94e40" version="3">Watch, maybe, but never intrude.</content>
  <content contentuid="he3f40e3eg5be9g4aefgb106g146d24f540b1" version="3">It's easy for some, of course. You and Karlach seem to be getting on very well.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2c013409gca2eg4c9dg9461g7f59e7275014" version="3">It's easy for some. I see Lae'zel's marked you as her territory.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5e21f221gaf95g4da7gbe03gb04acf9afaa1" version="3">You did a good thing. Suck it up and enjoy yourself.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf5bb97e1g3919g4833gaf79g2de8a9afcbce" version="4">Well, that'd certainly spice up this evening.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6ffce71cg6f11g4ad1g87b8g50cf9013ce81" version="2">I don't know what her idea of a good time is, but it seems to involve you. I'd hate to intrude.</content>
  <content contentuid="h93e68c44gbc15g41abg9806g4ee578bc24bd" version="3">It's just sex. Nothing serious.</content>

  <content contentuid="hc77b448age890g4f0dg8c7agbcc3fe949279" version="3">True. That was fun.</content>

  <content contentuid="ha6a295c2g7f11g4e3ag942fgd9c9f981f357" version="3">It's easy for some. You and Shadowheart seem to have a connection. It looks very sweet.</content>

  <content contentuid="h01695a07g1ca0g440bg83beg30bab4579044" version="2">Will you now? Don't take too long. You're not the only tasty morsel here.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9cdae993g8b2bg4b2bgaf8cgfd2410d42c4a" version="3">It's none of my business, of course. I wouldn't want to intrude.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc2c7ed50g1f0dg4c6cg861bg4f080a551c62" version="2">It's not that bad. Think of all the goblins you killed.</content>
  <content contentuid="h91ea400bg6bfdg40b6gb701ga7997dae93f6" version="2">No, Astarion. It's not happening.</content>
  <content contentuid="h04852622g2684g49ccg8a59g91600bc85b7e" version="2">Anyway, don't let me keep you. I'm sure you have someone else to sniff around. </content>
  <content contentuid="hba49502eg285dg437bgaf43g7b95018d5242" version="3">Indeed you will, my love. Indeed you will.</content>

  <content contentuid="ha0017736g803ag4deag9581g7ff53b631926" version="3">By the hells. Sex. Passion. &lt;i&gt;Fun.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="h62b170dfgbea2g4686ga18dg1bf84cf56966" version="2">Maybe. If you say 'please.'</content>
  <content contentuid="h554b6904g2d5cg4b17g9c7dgaa97a4c809c5" version="3">You're eager, aren't you? But we need to wait a little longer.</content>
  <content contentuid="he15d5f50g7a43g4efegbf62gbe5e5f9db605" version="2">A bed and so much more.</content>
  <content contentuid="h405a0f23g40c4g4f2dgbf38gc2411ca589c6" version="2">All right, but don't take too long. You're not the only tasty morsel around here.</content>
  <content contentuid="h815cdde7gb298g4983gbdadgc618f3b12f3b" version="3">Serious or not, it's something.</content>
  <content contentuid="h35216675g4be1g469agaf2eg2d99fcffbedd" version="2">You are an insolent little pup, aren't you?</content>
  <content contentuid="h459fc0bdg4c72g4cfdg9941gcea3b75793ef" version="2">I'm just looking for a little more excitement. A little more fun.</content>

  <content contentuid="hf43165f6g8be7g41b0g83bfg12c0d8a2763c" version="5">I'm kidding. Once everyone's asleep, I'll find you and we can have some fun.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6d6f8c69gc11ag4418g8ddfg9d88d160f307" version="2">Funny, but unbecoming.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf7401377g8dbag43afg9fd6g2a31409c3c9c" version="3">Never listen to your second thoughts. They always spoil the fun.</content>
  <content contentuid="he665d4ecgf0a5g435egb398g072858ee02d8" version="2">Do you mind? I'm very busy.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf546d1f8ga9c7g4b5eg808ag64a958d40782" version="2">Not at all! I was hoping for companionship and - well, maybe a little death. Figuratively speaking.</content>
  <content contentuid="h79942740gea8cg4e44gbae7g97212fb52f0d" version="4">We killed some goblins to save some tieflings. The tally of lives didn't change much.</content>
  <content contentuid="h985fbb4dgfc28g4a45gb71cg64336f991be1" version="3">Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the walking encyclopaedia.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3144d2abg8d14g4eaeg90aega7591355223f" version="2">I'm flattered, but I think not. It's not you, you understand, it's me.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0ac1bcdfge377g4ad3g86d6gd30235f0c78d" version="3">It's easy for some, of course. You and Wyll seem to be getting on very well.</content>
  <content contentuid="h31d3125dg0a16g49e4g955bgb21dbad18b4c" version="3">I'm sure it'll be adequate.</content>
  <content contentuid="h47968554gb271g46d7ga8d3g6c312bc7076d" version="2">By all means, go and enjoy yourself.</content>
  <content contentuid="he0607d96g0953g4795gb644g9de98b08ebdb" version="3">Ha! No, my love, you and Shadowheart can get up to whatever you want. It means nothing to me.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8e9520c7ge3abg4ec1g8c19geeab4957e357" version="3">All I want is a little fun. Is that so much to ask?</content>
  <content contentuid="ha9a7e2fcg5123g411agbefbgc4be73d1b983" version="3">All right, let's do it. I'll see you later.</content>

  <content contentuid="hdf99a9e1g8d21g48f2gb0edg495706e982f9" version="3">You know, we could always make our own entertainment, darling. Get a little closer, so to speak.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6ae46ab8gd010g49e1ga6acg7867d895bf0f" version="4">Knowing you, it probably is.</content>
  <content contentuid="h625df989g0a6fg461ag9c0bgbf94403294f3" version="3">Do you think Lae'zel would approve? I saw how she looked at you earlier.</content>
  <content contentuid="heee18e52gba5ag476eg870agc7997bbe6b22" version="2">On second thoughts, maybe not.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf3dc7af4geda9g4a8cg8c6fg86bf5b2a20d1" version="2">Knowing you, it probably is.</content>

  <content contentuid="hae40f904g4e1ag4402g99b6g8af68b3b641e" version="2">But fine. If you're determined to ruin your evening, I won't stop you.</content>

  <content contentuid="h1047e05cgac59g4ed1g88d1ga18d3f280a61" version="2">No, I wouldn't want to get in the middle of whatever that is. We'll end tonight as friends.</content>
  <content contentuid="he080ce68g8af5g4d1ag8b39g57d84d06e7ac" version="2">Ha! No, I've seen enough blades in my time.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd7d4ad07g560eg41f4g8e92gfdf10b4ee924" version="3">Feeling jealous, are you?</content>
  <content contentuid="h9d2482e5ge000g4623g93f0g00520c2e35c9" version="3">Are you looking forward to seeing his 'Blade of Frontiers'? I hope it's more greatsword than dagger.</content>
  <content contentuid="h58b760b3g9f46g4c24g9ebfgcdf0518f235f" version="3">Whinge all you want - I'm having fun.</content>
  <content contentuid="h054857abg3d9eg46e2gb024g1916918690dc" version="3">Maybe. I'll think about it.</content>
  <content contentuid="hce7155b9gf43ag4999g87c9gebd097703028" version="2">Not with you, just to be clear.</content>
  <content contentuid="h88547adfg16aeg4d99ga28bg5d6ae759a6a3" version="2">I'll be here, waiting for the sunrise.</content>

  <content contentuid="h939c033bg425ag4f5egac94g2285bed9b755" version="3">I'd rather bed a goblin, &lt;i&gt;darling&lt;/i&gt;.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf7c77c33g5e3dg4a4ag8bdcgf898aa23a800" version="3">Not what I'd call 'passionate', or 'interesting', but sweet.</content>
  <content contentuid="h172992cagec0bg4698gae15g725a02ba9728" version="3">But you go ahead. Have &lt;i&gt;fun&lt;/i&gt;.</content>

  <content contentuid="h54021c0cgba7cg4e05g9f86gb8632bad28d4" version="3">Ha! No. If he had an incubus instead of that cambion? That might be a different story.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3dbf1b37g9c94g4044g81dcge33f91e91c0e" version="2">But have it your way. I'm happy to entertain myself.</content>
  <content contentuid="h344cf4d3gb414g496fgba06g84564ba4328d" version="2">Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the beating our gith friend will give you.</content>
  <content contentuid="he0764a29g90e7g4a0cgb75cg3008e5f05af3" version="2">I'd hate to get between the gith and her trophy. No, I think we'll end this evening as friends.</content>

  <content contentuid="h1feda3efg27e9g4c25g9a59g80f175884912" version="3">Enjoy myself? There's a worm in my brain, hunters on my trail, and all I've got to drink is wine that tastes like vinegar.</content>

  <content contentuid="h827739e7gec1cg4c65gbddfg896c38b1c9f3" version="4">Nothing so dramatic. Just you and me and - well, maybe a little death? Figuratively speaking.</content>
  <content contentuid="hb676e7e5gba9bg4684gb448g1df6dbb6c47a" version="2">Once everyone's in their bedrolls, we'll slip out of ours and find each other.</content>

  <content contentuid="h8380897egc570g4943g818ag5a54d3124938" version="4">Well, I'd hate to get in the way of a well-laid plan. So to speak.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6c18fb82gcb84g4f5eg95eage58c8ee60b39" version="3">But fine. If you're determined to ruin your evening, I won't stop you.</content>

  <content contentuid="hbff46f8egfd4fg4a35g9263gcda92e5e8163" version="4">By the hells. Sex, my dear! Or whatever you can manage given your... situation.</content>
  <content contentuid="h933c6728ga644g4185g8cbeg55d5cc34a27b" version="4">By the hells. Sex, my dear. A night of passion.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha5f2dd59g823dg413cgbc16gff0f7d8b0b1b" version="2">Come on. There's a spark here. I know you've felt it too, darling.</content>
  <content contentuid="h749820a7ga6b2g44d2g9acdg0db91aeecb65" version="2">There isn't. I haven't. And that's all there is to it.</content>

  <content contentuid="hb0337b76g09dfg438cg8a80g9aa98e39cdd2" version="2">Be careful with that one. Her idea of a good time probably involves biting your head off halfway through the act.</content>
  <content contentuid="he8986f3dg8c25g41d7gae61gb20f3b88762b" version="3">Well, I'd planned to bed you...</content>

  <content contentuid="h9b597db2ge093g4a7egb9adg8962d5f2f13a" version="3">I just hope she leaves you in one piece. We can't take a tenday for you to recover from whatever her idea of 'fun' is.</content>
  <content contentuid="h83793336gecafg44e1gaefdgd6a0e762323c" version="2">So, has anyone in the camp caught your eye?</content>
  <content contentuid="h113700f5gd5c0g4d67g808cgf25319bd919b" version="3">Well, I'd had my heart set on bedding &lt;i&gt;you.&lt;/i&gt;</content>

  <content contentuid="hf95a4b56g9963g4cc3g9266g5edbd2ff1e15" version="3">Although you're doing well enough on your own. I see you and Shadowheart have a connection. It looks very sweet.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf71bd800g54d8g4690gbb43g998b73dec493" version="2">Well done! I'll see you tonight.</content>

  <content contentuid="hb25cfa78gb6ceg4c9agaaf7gf4cb87077706" version="2">I'm tempted by Lae'zel.</content>
  <content contentuid="h255c618dg6435g4677g817fg2bd7b9457abe" version="4">I'm not ashamed. I just don't feel like boasting about it.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8560fc2egd638g435bga9ccg3d1db2288e71" version="2">And I wish I was drinking out of Cazador's skull. Life is tough.</content>

  <content contentuid="h86245402g0327g47bdg859eg14fdced3fec6" version="2">I bet Minthara is fun.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3198fb3eg8d98g4605g8e34gd88c10436771" version="2">Ha! No, my love, I'm not jealous of the drow. You have all the fun you want - if you survive the night.</content>
  <content contentuid="h221bbb9fge315g4a19gb518g3a7e37636263" version="3">Does Shadowheart know that? I saw how she looked at you earlier.</content>
  <content contentuid="h18adabf7g80c1g466ag991cgb1cd0799f967" version="2">A bed and so much more.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6b178bb9g5a79g4b21gabf1gb25523b4789b" version="2">To getting rid of this tadpole.</content>
  <content contentuid="h05ea31d0ge45fg415fgb982g5a3ebf4d0e5c" version="2">Ha! No, it so rarely is. But it might be fun.</content>

  <content contentuid="h4bd79260g31fag41f8g8618g6490d285887e" version="2">But have it your way. I'm happy to entertain myself.</content>
  <content contentuid="h14bac43egd5d2g4b98g9f28gaaaa60fdb236" version="3">Ah, a good, full-bodied choice.</content>

  <content contentuid="ha44079bfgc311g4a00ga42dgdda2f3e29fee" version="4">Oh, a little talking, a little drinking, and - once everyone else is asleep - we get to know each other.</content>
  <content contentuid="hbaa45355gd1c4g4a14g9780g0366bf6863ba" version="2">Beer, if you have it.</content>

  <content contentuid="h2196632bga754g49c2gb362g45bc1d1ce23b" version="2">What do you mean?</content>
  <content contentuid="h4b005286g8850g4fa3ga0bcgff5754d6cd1d" version="4">How about some rest? It's been quite an evening.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8c3639c8g3a46g41c6g983fg2d3c65ae7995" version="3">Well, you have fun. I'm more than happy with my cup anyway.</content>
  <content contentuid="hba697457ge21ag4598g9180gbea77adc5481" version="3">Oh don't come crawling back. It's just embarrassing.</content>
  <content contentuid="h47ca8468ge2d3g4cfbg8940gf14b7eb16bac" version="2">I'm sure she is. If you can trust her not to bite your head off once you've done the deed.</content>

  <content contentuid="h9c1620bcg022fg4501gb24cg55b038fb5a6a" version="4">I'm glad you sought me out. Amid all this merriment I wasn't sure we'd have a chance to speak this evening.</content>

  <content contentuid="h2b56b2a5g233ag419eg8f24gfd8cb705a948" version="4">You're all too quick to abandon the one you promised yourself to. That is not a quality I admire.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0fdde262gfb38g4f89gac68gd163fea50570" version="4">You might be in for an adventure with Karlach. More than you bargained for - with a bit of luck.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7456a41cge4dag437ag812dg69b495ff730f" version="6">I'm glad you feel the same way. But, while I'm eager to enjoy your company on an exclusive basis later this evening, it would be selfish to keep you to myself before then. </content>
  <content contentuid="h7d7b6f6agdc2eg41cdg833eg2296a62fa68b" version="4">What were you going to show me?</content>
  <content contentuid="h1f9ef666g6ef4g4aabg9260gb90c70a2e0db" version="4">Or perhaps more than you bargained for - full stop.</content>
  <content contentuid="h62f3c88ag6d9fg4a28gb7a0g2d9966896c08" version="4">That or deadly nightshade.</content>
  <content contentuid="h35b76ef3gc01bg4b89gbe77g0bce062ebd0a" version="4">Lae'zel. Blade like a razor, wit like a razor, tongue like a razor.</content>
  <content contentuid="h68ae4ed6gacebg4480g8f4dg0900a69a418d" version="5">It's a view I would once have shared with my companion. Though definitely unaccompanied by such revelry.</content>
  <content contentuid="h77f06151g070dg40abgad6fgb2b77738152e" version="4">Don't stop now. What else do you like about me?</content>
  <content contentuid="h19696284g9fc7g4796gbe84g06fbefe5896a" version="6">You remind me of her somewhat. An expression you both share - when she gives in to her more feline qualities, a mouse trapped beneath her paw...</content>
  <content contentuid="h593f2dc2g5636g44b6g9084g5638cf6ebe2a" version="5">Not that I don't appreciate your musk. I actually rather like it...</content>
  <content contentuid="hae66b0b4g78e3g43a7gb8ffg33987b0b19d3" version="5">A beautiful night, don't you think? Nothing like a brush with destruction to make one appreciate the majesty of the celestial canvas.</content>
  <content contentuid="h006fef11g4753g4b3fga341g5e77d862f1dd" version="4">Nonetheless, your finer qualities are remarkably plentiful.</content>
  <content contentuid="h83732515gd4d1g4829g83dag4f9efd41b971" version="4">Right. Understood. You shall hear no more on the subject from me.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3745f0adg194fg476dg9e24ga9a40f7d2bf2" version="7">I used to while away many hours just like these with my companion, though in far comfier surrounds.</content>
  <content contentuid="h512db164gdcc1g4640g81d7g28563f940a44" version="5">Don't worry about me - I'm quite content to enjoy the party from here. Go, enjoy yourself.</content>
  <content contentuid="h40c35773gca4cg4539g94e3ge11d1aa533ee" version="4">Suffice it to say, I think rather a lot of you. And there aren't many on this plane who I'd give such high praise.</content>
  <content contentuid="h40268f4cg7a59g4737gb564g76b0e67c2c00" version="3">Friends with the mighty Gale of Waterdeep? I'd be honoured.</content>
  <content contentuid="h50437adegbcd4g4378ga542gd5f7401f02e2" version="3">Actually, I was thinking we'd be wonderful &lt;i&gt;together&lt;/i&gt;...</content>
  <content contentuid="h58456324gf7f2g4810g9144g55f075efef5a" version="3">Who are you referring to? A former lover, perhaps?</content>
  <content contentuid="hb2da63d1g3e56g45abgb8abg9850f8e30940" version="6">I assure you, were you to meet Tara you would see the comparison for the flattery it is. But perhaps that's not a point worth labouring further.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcd022596gb138g48a6g99b6g8c17e6f8f02b" version="6">I'm flattered. Is your good opinion so hard to come by?</content>
  <content contentuid="h504e531egc5beg4860gbf83g8a0a7e27be87" version="4">Please - feel free to enjoy yourself elsewhere. No doubt there are others here who offer more welcome company.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9c30cde9g9033g420agacc6g0e7379e4a67f" version="3">I've got aquaintances, certainly. Plenty of colleagues. But friends? Those are precious indeed.</content>
  <content contentuid="h65b8618egc42dg46c6gaaa1gb619c8f07edf" version="6">'Smart' does her a disservice. She's a fine wizard in her own right, though somewhat held back by her lack of opposable thumbs.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4ca5758dg1957g4ca5g807fgf0caf2843bc1" version="5">After so long being cared for by someone else, it feels good to have repaid the favour. Not directly to Tara, but to these poor tieflings. I'm sure she would approve.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8adc3385gcf8bg482cgbc5dg004e21ec6293" version="3">What is Tara like?</content>
  <content contentuid="h7826040ag41e4g49bagbc7cg52057b57b965" version="4">Don't stop there. What else do you like about me?</content>
  <content contentuid="h35b99154g6742g44f8g9aaegf1ecc4d89385" version="5">The pleasures I experienced in Mystra's embrace go far beyond the thrill of having one's tummy tickled. I remember once, she took the smallest piece of the Weave and made it into - </content>
  <content contentuid="h71ce39b5g33abg493ag8cf7g790b14cbd464" version="4">She'll love you. So long as you don't rub her belly. She &lt;i&gt;hates&lt;/i&gt; it when anyone does that.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5e6db6d3g0c55g48e7g9bdbg74ce3ad94fc7" version="5">I'm glad. To know you enjoy my company is, well, it's rather wonderful actually. I'd be loathe to waste the time of someone who's become rather important to me.</content>
  <content contentuid="he4a6742cge22fg40d5g8bceg9fa93ba4f725" version="6">I see. Then perhaps we see each other in the same light after all. A resplendent one, flush with warmth and anticipation, but one which I must shy away from, for now.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf63bb7e3gb9b2g4a76gb7ecgde1c31ca7e2b" version="5">I'd given up on myself, but Tara never did. It was her encouragement, her research that led me to my treatment. Once we knew that magically-infused items were the key, she went out to find them for me. She saved my life.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8765cbe8gedd6g4271g8889g9a0169be12f1" version="4">Go, indulge in the frivolities - they're good for the heart. And mine will be all the lighter, to see you enjoying yourself.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd06d77a5gb3aag49a1g9584gc11d226dca7c" version="3">She sounds like a fine animal. One I'd be honoured to know.</content>
  <content contentuid="h98ac6b3eg6a2dg40afg944fgee3a42f856b5" version="4">Even in such fraught times as these, there is peace to be found in the stillness as evening draws in.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0dbf8d5dg80e0g4489gaae5ge4fc3eb41a21" version="4">Wine is to wit as meat is to... to... oh, I can't bloody remember it. There I go, then, proving your point.</content>
  <content contentuid="h63597ae8gbc16g4a29g936ag21dafff18dfa" version="4">What if she doesn't like me?</content>
  <content contentuid="h2e158e53gf007g4b8dgbe67g51f4cca38b57" version="4">I wouldn't call this a friendship. More a series of necessary interactions.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc7012866gc76dg4a72gae76g59ff8c923694" version="6">I wish she were here for me to make a formal introduction, but I would never ask her to undertake such a journey. She is safer at home.</content>
  <content contentuid="h69f50ad8g1bd2g45ccgb46bge17e5b4a9de4" version="5">I assure you, when I tell someone they're wonderful - I mean it. And you are wonderful.</content>
  <content contentuid="heae643e3g204ag4045g96bbg98cdb99243d1" version="4">Go - enjoy your evening. Nothing better for the heart than a good night's rest, and mine is gladdened to know I'll have the pleasure of your company again come morning.</content>
  <content contentuid="h80118888g413dg4c21gaa3dg4f615f079972" version="6">You remind me of her somewhat. There's a steeliness to you, an unwavering tenacity even in the face of, to be frank, quite dire odds.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7bc39692gca83g4b0bg8b4cg69eccc68a27a" version="6">Tara is not any cat. She's a &lt;i&gt;tressym&lt;/i&gt;. And given your confusion, I'm guessing you've never met one. They're brilliant creatures - fine company for any self-respecting wizard.</content>
  <content contentuid="h728de19egbde9g44edg8c5bgcc02ccfd8637" version="5">Besides, she was always telling me I needed to spread my wings, so to speak. Find mortal friends, instead of hanging onto Mystra's coattails. So that's what I'm doing. I hope.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd409e2d4g9a29g49d9ga5cdg9243efbf2883" version="3">I hope you aren't talking about Mystra again...</content>

  <content contentuid="h0d0de4feg69cbg41a6ga159g5faa1d3bdccf" version="5">You remind me of her somewhat. The same sharp tongue. And sharp teeth.</content>
  <content contentuid="h98ddc789g23fag45bdgbeb4g970be792c633" version="6">I speak of Tara, my tressym, assistant, my constant companion through all the ills and tribulations my hubris has thrust upon me.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf96526b1g4168g4d02gb320gf7470c45d4de" version="6">You're the first person I've spent any significant time with in a year or more. Spending time in your company, I realise that I may have left behind the greater part of my wit, and sensitivity, in my tower.</content>
  <content contentuid="h596aacf7g61c5g4faeg9404g016af5e62b8c" version="5">You remind me of her somewhat. Something in the way you roll your eyes when I speak...</content>
  <content contentuid="h3faef2edg37b3g4f49g99a8gcc483bdee345" version="4">Do you like having your belly rubbed?</content>
  <content contentuid="h5b11a28eg8229g4b0ega758g4b69f3fb6fc5" version="6">Sadly not. If I'm being entirely honest, my social circle is rather small. More of a dot. Or a pinhead.</content>
  <content contentuid="h325dd0a7g4069g430egad57gff8425e6ab02" version="5">You must have been lonely, with only Tara for company...</content>
  <content contentuid="h8658a7c0g35e0g44c9gafcbg908bd9e1a508" version="5">Bad luck on that front - I'm actually a nymph in disguise...</content>
  <content contentuid="h1ad5eb31g0ee1g4158g9b6fg60be1546c3a4" version="4">Then let me say it more plainly -</content>
  <content contentuid="hf30ef5d5ge733g475dg9b10g00d4a4a0d3bc" version="6">However, my sentiments are all I can offer at present. With my condition as volatile as it is, I wouldn't want to indulge in any undue, erm, &lt;i&gt;excitement&lt;/i&gt;. So to speak.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8a9075c7g0da4g4ba2g8d4cg8d8b9d439349" version="4">You know what, I think I've clearly had far too much wine. And you've had nowhere near enough. I think this is a conversation best held back on - for now.</content>
  <content contentuid="h21e1cfb2g5bf3g473fgaaa4g8455ae6af4c4" version="5">I think you're rather wonderful. And that's not a word I waste on anyone unworthy of it.</content>
  <content contentuid="hfbee441cg8cbdg4278g983egb73d10f9c818" version="7">She preferred it when we were alone, curled up before a crackling hearth with some ancient, esoteric tome between us, ink glinting in the firelight...</content>
  <content contentuid="h9c3e004cg911ag42cbga528g03386ca00e05" version="7">Being mentioned in the same breath as your pet isn't the compliment you think it is...</content>
  <content contentuid="h2b3e08d7gcab8g467dga4b8ga1c3610ea077" version="5">She has a good heart, and she would recognise the same in your actions here. I'm sure she'd approve of me lending myself to your efforts.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6df7f82ag76d8g47e7g8a3eg093c7d7d7a9c" version="6">Sometimes. But I imposed it upon myself, after all. I set up enough wards to keep an army at bay, never mind the few colleagues who sought to inquire about my welfare.</content>
  <content contentuid="h09f24786gba30g433dgbba3g28779acdc4ee" version="5">Tara did her best to keep my spirits up, of course, but there's only so much one tressym can make up for one's entire social circle. And she was often gone seeking items to treat my condition.</content>
  <content contentuid="he4a1c9cag240cg4609g8fdfg9d229d6596be" version="5">I can't say I share the same high opinion of you, Gale.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3b995e0eg5ec5g493dga69cg65c1db578320" version="6">She'd be proud to see me keeping such fine company - the saviour of those poor tieflings, no less. And I've given her precious little to be proud of recently.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc6725315gd7b7g42dega63fg4263d2532738" version="4">You don't have any friends?</content>
  <content contentuid="h76af3175g60c8g4d41ga2f3gd499a9263294" version="8">Not an animal lover? Nobody's perfect, I suppose.</content>
  <content contentuid="hfc6f8255ge201g46begb2e1g49d2e5e72042" version="5">If this is an attempt at flirting, you should stop. I'm not interested.</content>
  <content contentuid="hec562b96g0f55g4e70g8aabgf3b82454120c" version="4">She sounds great. But I was hoping I meant more to you than an animal companion...</content>
  <content contentuid="hd2f89a3bg457ag4732gad91ge5263bd79e43" version="4">Consider this budding romance thoroughly nipped. Though I hope our friendship need not come to such an abrupt end.</content>
  <content contentuid="h827cf3e6ga993g4638g89a8g0a0afc577c7e" version="4">That depends. What do you like about me?</content>
  <content contentuid="hb79191a4ge553g416cg8f83g1bd8d1ab1d41" version="5">Don't let me drag you away. Enjoy yourself - you earned a night of revelry.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0897b427gc774g40cfga635g89d969d36adb" version="7">I rather like the Gale stood in front of me. In fact, I'd like to see more of him...</content>
  <content contentuid="h69137b9cg3a30g43fdga8a5g196bb0b746b4" version="5">Of course. I hoped we might be more than friends...</content>
  <content contentuid="h3f801b13g456dg4328g8204gbb134387462c" version="5">I'm not interested in you, Gale. Not in that way.</content>
  <content contentuid="h81990df1g6a95g45fag87e4g26fa0b5144e0" version="5">Always bringing such candour to our conversations. Some would think twice about mocking Gale of Waterdeep, but you just go straight for the gut.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4b7e3807geea2g4b19gbe51gb49f34a8830f" version="8">The feeling's mutual - you're a wonderful friend. Though usually more... erudite.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8de24263g6a54g41ffga483ge319b17d831e" version="3">Are you... are you talking about your &lt;i&gt;cat&lt;/i&gt;?</content>
  <content contentuid="hcabfbdf5g6a84g49a8g8450g19187341e13f" version="8">No one came to visit you during your confinement?</content>
  <content contentuid="ha9f4575bgdb6cg4760g9abbgf60385988e46" version="6">Wait. Are you saying...</content>
  <content contentuid="h08ebdf42gcf72g42d0g9cdcga992a85d89d8" version="6">She must be very smart, to have done all that.</content>
  <content contentuid="hba2b3e35g7486g4a9agb452gad0c5ca4e90d" version="4">I like that about you. It's one of your rarer qualities, though I fear my ego can take no more of it tonight.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc0b7702dg218cg46bbg9844g61a9ca8b7bbb" version="3">You're doing just fine, Gale.</content>
  <content contentuid="h30d6a1c5g1295g409fga658g66a2d87e27d9" version="6">After I was afflicted with my condition, I locked myself in my tower for an entire year. I was inconsolable, wallowing in my self-inflicted tragedy.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3b648449gb9f0g4b50g9ef4g43980c6ebbea" version="5">So I remind you of your pet? How romantic...</content>
  <content contentuid="h5f08851eg9bb7g450bg9152gd616f9c54250" version="5">With my condition as volatile as it is, I fear any undue, er, excitement, may tip it over the edge. So to speak.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdee6c1b9ga8abg4974gb978g0e58f94b32e7" version="5">Not as much as I hate talking about cats. Is there nothing else on your mind?</content>
  <content contentuid="h4f69cca5g852fg4ad2gbfddg3df81fd12126" version="4">Perhaps we'd better leave it at that. My ineloquent tongue isn't worthy of your ear at present.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf09f3d7cg9327g42c0g977egdd7ed837f7bd" version="4">You remind me of her somewhat. You share her fierceness, and her passion.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdebd2d00g2b54g4507g8c8dgc00b60ffde84" version="5">You remind me of her somewhat. You share her pragmatic streak.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9a48de5bg8413g454eg8c09g60d86ca83402" version="4">Well, this seems as good a time as any for me to stop babbling on.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4cf93a4agcc4cg4c66g89b5geebf28d24db3" version="4">Sounds, er, fun.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc7ff8f66gbda3g44adgb209g384b110e64d0" version="6">Not everyone is comfortable being alone with their thoughts. Though I never felt alone with a book in my hand. Or with her for company.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3d2a3728g920ag4650gaf14g505b57554ae3" version="4">Were I to recite that list, I fear we'd still be here at dusk tomorrow. Many things, I assure you, but a conversation better saved for another time.</content>
  <content contentuid="h29fd264fgdb3dg4c20g959agf6a3008ce979" version="5">Very funny. But as we all know, nymphs are sticklers when it comes to their bathing routines. You, my friend, haven't been near a fresh spring in a tenday or more.</content>
  <content contentuid="h96aa67fbg103bg4d51g8789ge6d6a8a9d6da" version="4">You remind me of her somewhat. You share a certain nobility of spirit.</content>
  <content contentuid="h966fa781g9450g43cfg8c50g470193319783" version="5">She'd be most impressed by our efforts saving these tieflings. Proud, even. And I've given her little to be proud of recently.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7b4663eeg51e2g4a7bga6f8g908c239f68d3" version="5">By Ahghairon's lost nose - no!</content>
  <content contentuid="h7d46057dg0923g438dga264g52a784b2c709" version="4">I hope, though we've only known each other for a short time, I might be able to count you among that number?</content>
  <content contentuid="h1b1b6e13gce56g4b49g81a6g80b5af0dfffb" version="3">Was I that obvious?</content>
  <content contentuid="h7c10c2bag072bg4d37g9a70g95848201baef" version="3">These people are still in danger.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc92c5049g9598g43bag8279g4897f73aa7a8" version="4">I like you, Wyll. And I want to know you better.</content>
  <content contentuid="h683d8c87g3654g4d46g8755gc2eb6bdf3beb" version="4">If only faith was enough to ward off every bully of the wilds.</content>
  <content contentuid="he0ecabf6g949fg49cfga04dg5de6c85d2902" version="3">I just wanted to check up on you, that's all.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf6bc63a1g1ebeg4d4dgbc09g87566c206233" version="4">I'm not sure that I am. But it means something that you think so.</content>
  <content contentuid="h355aeceag5fa5g4eb7g95c4g3e3caffe1662" version="3">But who am I fooling? I can't go back to that life. </content>
  <content contentuid="h5a74d07cg7f70g40abga379gdcea5e805e85" version="4">I wish you were there, but I'll respect your need for peace.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0c474646g4500g48ddg8de6g89aa6327ccb0" version="3">I love the way your nose wrinkles up when you get the scent of a lead for the first time.</content>
  <content contentuid="h97f00c6agd49eg4948g9ab9g02288db1ea86" version="3">You must be Volo in disguise, out here to harangue me for some tales of the Frontiers.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcfef9838g1c2dg4009gbe73g106c39e404aa" version="4">Though I can't say I've earned the honour.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4ff8b733gf39eg4428g91a5g89b0e164052e" version="3">You're impossible. </content>
  <content contentuid="h9e2c49a6gaedag46a5gbd77gbd378f789719" version="3">Maybe another time. Now, you've got a party to get back to. Don't forget, tonight is about &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.</content>
  <content contentuid="hea7b75fdg23ceg441fgbf16g1abfd995380c" version="5">Saving the people of the grove was all the satisfaction I could ask.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha7b76f37gad23g485fg940dg7a375a6bfd43" version="3">I know how to have fun! I have lots of fun every day!</content>
  <content contentuid="hca7c8726g3745g410fg9b05g161d285ef5f2" version="3">I just wanted a quick chat. I'll leave you to it.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha9dda53bgad12g4cc0gbc3bg8c5c64c0071a" version="3">You don't unsettle me, you know that.</content>
  <content contentuid="h647ec42bgedcbg4db8gb842g0a1bb75b109d" version="4">We all die. But life's still worth the living. Otherwise, what's the point of it?</content>
  <content contentuid="h72cb668fge5efg4ceag83b5g67bb5d369daa" version="4">I feel spikes beginning to sprout &lt;i&gt;in places they really shouldn't.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="h859bfac3gb4b1g41aeg9575g5c586a85923b" version="4">Oh! Seems I stumbled ahead of myself. Wouldn't be the first time.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8b46c2e2ge4efg43e8g9856g680b7568c060" version="3">We have won this day! Danger is for tomorrow.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6c02b4f2g6b3fg491agacecg8660fcabdad5" version="3">Clearly Mol has put you up to stealing my britches so you can turn them into a flag for her gang.</content>
  <content contentuid="he74bc1ddgd7dbg4f8cg9535g06c712b4b720" version="3">Maybe just a little.</content>
  <content contentuid="he89b81a9g5efcg48f1ga4aagb6683dc39dbe" version="3">There will be another time for us.</content>
  <content contentuid="h004e8ffbg65f9g4f3dgae0dg659078407d7d" version="5">You're good at it. You've given me some just by being here.</content>
  <content contentuid="h83938045g92d2g4d7ag85a9gbb76cf6f724e" version="3">They aren't ready to get on the road on their own.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3bdeb676g220bg43f7gb318g3ba5e5f7fde7" version="3">I'm afraid my feet are firmly planted to the ground this evening.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdce65435ge375g44b2g9cc6g042c32421cce" version="3">You were hoping for some peace and quiet out in the forest, and I have ruined your night entirely.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7f7755e0g8707g4c55g9bccgfbfb7a493617" version="3">I don't need a &lt;i&gt;party&lt;/i&gt; on top of that!</content>
  <content contentuid="h0d3feaf7g8b9eg40f2g957dg4ca6d14b011a" version="5">Have a laugh, make some noise. I'll be my charming self before you know it.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha39a1724g2ef1g4a38g94eag6fe2eca72ba2" version="3">A kiss? Well - I can't say I'm not tempted. But not here, not now.</content>
  <content contentuid="h89e2a8bcgdd2eg4a75g9e0dgfec27ac59efa" version="3">You're right, but we need to give them hope.</content>
  <content contentuid="h381b516bg8810g4b7dga1a2g20878a8d0767" version="3">I once beat the Baldurian record for the most &lt;i&gt;sarabandes &lt;/i&gt;danced in a single evening.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcaefbb3eg61b9g4b8ag87fbgedd4e3df43fd" version="4">Sorry it has you feeling rough tonight.</content>
  <content contentuid="h82a6cb36gcaadg4e2fg947bg75e5a8f99732" version="3">Damn right I'm fond of you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h385ecf35g9913g4e7cg97f9g02ccb73070b2" version="3">Keep trying!</content>
  <content contentuid="h93826f5cg2346g431bg84beg5504b86ea74e" version="3">You're halfway right.</content>
  <content contentuid="h62386f00ga825g4742g8612g74284f2cb740" version="5">Ha! In truth, I always enjoyed a bit of pomp.</content>
  <content contentuid="h00a42d1fg39cdg4dc0gb2e9g35b9e588ba1c" version="3">Agh, Hells! I was hoping you wouldn't notice I was gone.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9a6a5be6ge155g4466g87edg8c9d83eaf3da" version="3">Gods know why. You'd be well within your rights to burn me alive.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha6048017gfe57g4980g82d3g4597f7a96ead" version="4">Your words cheer me more than any party could.</content>
  <content contentuid="h84070e42gcf39g4f4bg874agd13c658e9a94" version="4">I better come clean - I wanted a kiss.</content>
  <content contentuid="h02cb3d25g1c07g4f2cg8a37g0a484d8c7024" version="4">You have many talents, but subtlety isn't one of them.</content>
  <content contentuid="h72700e9dg628ag4ec1gb5afgf0cce871e500" version="3">Why else? There couldn't be &lt;i&gt;another &lt;/i&gt;reason.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5e91e512g9e09g493eg918fgeec5d4e56ec8" version="5">I had years of lessons but in truth, it's all about your partner.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha858ced2g109bg4b26g94a0g746e1ac543d6" version="3">If not a dance, then maybe a kiss.</content>
  <content contentuid="hae8093adgfad5g4e15g9e1cgd9cef3130270" version="3">For you, it's as clear as cool water you have that heroism within you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0dde00b5g42e4g47c1g89a0gb96ce16e6141" version="5">I'm a devil. I love the people from the grove, but I unsettle them deep down.</content>
  <content contentuid="h96262656g938ag4190g95e8gc7b57066db2d" version="3">But not tonight. Tonight is about you.</content>
  <content contentuid="had33ce12g0309g4602gb9b8gfbdff467d6f1" version="4">It's a long shot, but - maybe you've grown fond of me.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8a9fb912g6637g448egb4a7g5c6e6b8f8a73" version="3">&lt;i&gt;Leave.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="hc22b5c54geccfg4b5dgb699ga87e215ace06" version="3">Ouch! You don't need to mock me when I'm feeling low.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6861cfeeg2d61g471bg886cg40cad8f9058c" version="3">Thanks. It's good to know someone's looking out.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcb8174d5g05e2g4f95ga6f5gdb55a736240e" version="5">In truth, I don't feel in a festive mood, and didn't want to cast a grey cloud over the night.</content>
  <content contentuid="h56aa247egeceag4327ga322g57742a40c836" version="3">You cut quite a fine figure. I can just imagine leading you with an entire ballroom watching.</content>
  <content contentuid="h025984c3g7fe1g4d20g8498gf4d04332c5a8" version="5">But off with you. This is your day! Have a dance. Enjoy the music. </content>
  <content contentuid="hcf6d59d3g9b7ag403ega6cdg8ee844610664" version="4">Maybe.</content>
  <content contentuid="hadda219egf603g4e15gbd8ag381f8562e292" version="6">It's a long shot, but - maybe you've grown fond of me. Gods know I've grown fond of you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h281985f7ge973g4169gb477g382aa0d00598" version="4">Still - it's a night to remember. You've made sure of that.</content>
  <content contentuid="h685b4335g385bg470dg9868gbd8e19035b49" version="3">As I seem to unsettle everyone nowadays.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9544cf12g7575g4547gb2b4gdcdd59b2f127" version="3">So? If they die, they die. That's life for you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5cfd6460ga96ag4683gb9dagdef0de161e14" version="4">If so, I'm afraid I must remain a passing fancy. If not, well, it wouldn't be my first misjudgement.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc5dc6697g756ag4fffga9adg51fdb5a24fdc" version="4">Too many reasons to count. I might share them someday.</content>
  <content contentuid="h700e07c5gde86g4964gbd99g9992d7deb613" version="3">Aw, by Balduran's elbow, I can't stay feeling gloomy with you looking at me like that.</content>
  <content contentuid="hfc63d8d9g85e2g4812g97dag7d5f6fb4b822" version="3">To our kind, those features just make you more attractive.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0554d69dg4035g47b9g99a7g94863e47f879" version="3">Sounds like some pretty words for sulking to me!</content>
  <content contentuid="ha4051cfdg3f6fg4972ga343g60a67fee5618" version="3">Have some faith. Whatever happens, they'll survive it.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdda24684g9d7fg4f09gbec4g5b68f7199371" version="3">I - well, then. Erm, you've got a party to get back to. After all, tonight is about &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd73aa9dfgf3eeg42fega2f9g2befb5e9e8f7" version="8">The world spits on those partial to devils. I'm hardly a prime catch.</content>
  <content contentuid="hbdc56b94g8619g4718ga684ga1425843b205" version="4">Let me think... Why are you really here?</content>
  <content contentuid="hf802274agd43bg4057g9cabg0cc70e573810" version="3">Don't complain. We're all still alive, aren't we?</content>
  <content contentuid="h48966799g6aa6g47c0g8476g86ac38c8d0b0" version="3">Not that I'd necessarily object.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5a8f5e12g14d1g47e8g8329g239ddf531724" version="4">Because I like you. And I want to know you better.</content>
  <content contentuid="h299b4a0cgc24ag40a7ga5b9g545115736e7d" version="3">&lt;i&gt;Ahem&lt;/i&gt;.</content>

  <content contentuid="h90957dabg737eg4755gb7d2ge36b3c9b3ffc" version="4">I know. What I want and what I can have are two very different things. </content>
  <content contentuid="h62f9720fg7302g4b44g92ebg0fbefa99d620" version="3">Maybe we should keep our distance, then.</content>
  <content contentuid="h62875c94gc19eg499dg90aeg381792864985" version="3">All true, but there's more than that. Or have you forgotten the fine art of conversation?</content>
  <content contentuid="hb46e7488g5fefg455dgbaf3gd28a50454220" version="4">Please. My life is an instant mood-killer, and I'm enjoying this mood. Maybe even a little too much.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7f57ded1ga37fg48e2g92e2g6c22353fb9f2" version="3">Maybe I can't touch you, but I could &lt;i&gt;tell &lt;/i&gt;you what I'd like to do with you...</content>
  <content contentuid="h63fbd4f9gb172g4518g827eg35dabd0f963f" version="3">Let's talk. I still know so little about you.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdcefb022g5f6ag4553gac66g0b099588071c" version="3">Around you? Tall order. But if you've got an idea, I'm all ears.</content>
  <content contentuid="hb4c8a1fdg697eg4332g8e03gfcbb226e3123" version="3">Ugh, I'm terrible at this. What should we do now?</content>
  <content contentuid="hc282ee20gcea9g49d6gb7e2g110e471b0eab" version="3">Not particularly.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf960341dg0980g49abg943dg449d3b8aef5a" version="3">My turn.</content>
  <content contentuid="h73b3906fgaac8g4d0bg926ag0c5cc5cae8ff" version="6">Ugh, I'm sorry - I shouldn't tease you - or myself. I'd give anything to touch you, but I can't. Not until I can be sure I won't burn you.</content>
  <content contentuid="hccda89c0ga1aeg4c11gafc6g4b1da19e1268" version="3">Let's try breathing deeply, in and out.</content>
  <content contentuid="h78f5ef5bg0d32g4b27ga6c9g79d44c8e3f2c" version="3">Evil would be grabbing you and kissing you with no regard for the consequences.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4953ec21g830cg4d6dg82fag8f871d1ff5e2" version="3">Sorry if I was a little forward. Ten years in Avernus and I guess I've forgotten whatever manners I might've had.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha12b5c8cgdc50g4f59ga5cag245389fcab4d" version="4">I know some magic that might help me handle your fire. Let me see...</content>

  <content contentuid="hca71a993g3ed7g4df1gacafg1ca15bb43f3c" version="3">Psst! Hey soldier - you aren't asleep, are you?</content>
  <content contentuid="h46d1f4f8g16ecg442egb0abg3ea03af41ed2" version="4">Thank the gods. I was afraid I was the only one. Ten years is a long time to be trapped in the Hells. Ten years without a kind word, a touch.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8bfbf156gea57g4b5egad26g15209585eec5" version="3">Then let me backtrack and take you up on your first offer. Something about seeing stars?</content>
  <content contentuid="h9c0598dfg3b61g4c30g9e03g20368b7c3c36" version="3">Ah come on, don't give me that. We're here, we're alive, we're &lt;i&gt;together.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="h2b11b32bg5bf3g43a0gbf4bgc5a1ef127819" version="3">On that note, I'd better head back to my bunk. &lt;i&gt;You &lt;/i&gt;might not be able to touch me, but you've given me a lot to... &lt;i&gt;think &lt;/i&gt;about.</content>
  <content contentuid="he9d51dd4g9ae6g47e4g95f2gca539b8cfe7e" version="3">I like the sound of that.</content>

  <content contentuid="h6f8227c1ge6c6g4e7ag8821g854a3460a76b" version="4">When I look at you, I feel real again. Alive. Gods, I want to ride you 'til you see stars.</content>
  <content contentuid="h81a4879agfb87g4de1g830eg09c938f78f02" version="3">I held my own against the devils and imps, but they weren't my friends. How could they be? You don't go to the Hells to &lt;i&gt;live&lt;/i&gt;. You go to punish and be punished.</content>
  <content contentuid="h40a113d7g9b72g4167ga1e6g0f886eba6c95" version="4">Hello, you. I've been waiting for this all night.</content>

  <content contentuid="h9f6c446cg7df8g4385ga16ag9edcb1bc9ed9" version="3">I'm buzzing, honestly. I couldn't wait to talk to you.</content>
  <content contentuid="habf46717g11bdg4074g8dd4g588348405f4d" version="3">Yes! Soldier, you're &lt;i&gt;saving &lt;/i&gt;me. Every time you speak my name, fight beside me, share what's yours, I'm reminded that I'm &lt;i&gt;alive&lt;/i&gt;. Properly alive. And &lt;i&gt;free.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="h6ad09979g85c2g44d2ga5fdg8aa8b038b77e" version="4">&lt;i&gt;It's too hot - pull away.&lt;/i&gt;</content>

  <content contentuid="h0fc2abf1g1b91g4e3cgba34g34bb753ac8c1" version="3">You don't mince words, do you?</content>
  <content contentuid="h87fecf10g1878g4d4egb585gb1b321863398" version="3">I'm just... ngh... &lt;i&gt;combustible&lt;/i&gt;. Ten years is a long time without anyone's touch but my own. And when I look at you, I just feel... explosive.</content>
  <content contentuid="h408b42afg3ee0g41d9gbb27ga75596e7a41d" version="3">I never made peace with my life in Avernus. Ten years, and I never accepted that &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;was what my life would be.</content>
  <content contentuid="haafb3cfdge89cg4369g8e62g07db56cc3cf8" version="4">Not true! I know you're a goblin-destroyer, an adventurer, and most importantly, I know &lt;i&gt;you &lt;/i&gt;like &lt;i&gt;me.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="h8dba7cddge14dg4fbdga113g9228a88aa451" version="3">How about just one kiss?</content>

  <content contentuid="h2b05780bg3dbag41a6gb25fg2360ef7d89f7" version="4">You have no idea. If I weren't so worried about killing you, I'd be in a puddle on the floor.</content>
  <content contentuid="h31c759d6g17ffg4f0cga38cg72a97615094c" version="4">Heya soldier - I think everyone's asleep. May I?</content>
  <content contentuid="hbb98e4dfg5d7cg48edg8738ge2999e08843b" version="4">The best worst decision. So what do we do now?</content>
  <content contentuid="h248b7bc5g9e13g4622gbffbg1b361166bb6e" version="3">Don't tempt me. It isn't fair.</content>

  <content contentuid="h3a08d0feg4ba7g46efg9567ga9570f308b6f" version="7">Maybe even manage a pat or bump without burning someone to death. It's been a &lt;i&gt;long &lt;/i&gt;time.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf0fefe0bg9ff0g427egbe20g78e09893dfb0" version="7">Haha! I really know how to lay it on thick, don't I? Ah well. What can I say? I'm excited to be alive. And excited about what's to come.</content>
  <content contentuid="hb8dbd9fdga901g4542g8923gd540c064fbc0" version="7">Wild, right? And believe it or not, I'm one of Zariel's &lt;i&gt;least&lt;/i&gt;-mutilated pets.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6702fd4eg5f33g491dg87ddge8cbbc318d14" version="7">Speaking of, from where I'm standing it looks like you and Shadowheart are getting more... &lt;i&gt;familiar&lt;/i&gt;.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha3a4ed1eg3a4fg49a8ga7bcg39cfe766e122" version="7">Enjoy yourself tonight. You've earned it.</content>
  <content contentuid="he03908a2ga578g41b2ga165ge08f7c4caab4" version="8">The one nice thing about being trapped in the inexorable grind of time is you've always got something to look forward to.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7ea6ff4agfd91g4a4dg93f7g74c3f7f3ea9f" version="7">It also means if I'm heated at all - excited, nervous, scared - I'm &lt;i&gt;way &lt;/i&gt;too hot to touch.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7dadd55ag3cc5g47e0g9d7cg8e8477e9ecfa" version="7">But let's not get into tragic backstories now. It's such a beautiful night.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5794ffecga021g4e26ga37cg519edb1aa5ae" version="7">Don't worry. I will. And I've got a good arm, you know.</content>
  <content contentuid="hef3cd9cdga77bg4273g8d85g6cebc6c0f02a" version="7">I don't know if you mean that. But I hope you do.</content>

  <content contentuid="heec6c681g4605g41bfgb9c7g4e1dd875d837" version="8">I want to be with you. Everything else is just a distraction.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3ce6627cg4885g4851gab7dg9392fa29c021" version="7">Ah, come on. I know I'm not really who you're interested in. And anyway, even if I were, you couldn't touch me without getting burnt to a crisp.</content>
  <content contentuid="h20d18804g70b4g4c95gaa0eg87c3df2b818d" version="7">I'd really like that.</content>
  <content contentuid="he2487881gd5ebg4af1gaa29gfeb5ec46eddc" version="7">I like you too. A &lt;i&gt;lot. &lt;/i&gt;I'm sure you know that by now.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcd5dbd0fg63aeg45c2gb6d3gf43f0485f486" version="8">Really now? Cause I think you suit me perfectly.</content>
  <content contentuid="h10bc4ab3g6a7cg4702g85b4gfe0850d6b97d" version="7">I tried to make friends at first. Learned my lesson fast. Better to keep to yourself in Hell.</content>

  <content contentuid="hae0fa57cg420ag4306g832bgb35f6bb97792" version="8">That's well and good, but beware. Paragons don't last long on the open road.</content>

  <content contentuid="ha6b6a568gaa2fg4509ga272gb6d6f2311cd3" version="8">I can handle it. After all, life was made to be lived. And that's exactly what you're doing.</content>
  <content contentuid="h078ac5ccg74fag4eefgb1b0ga8ef9e852ac3" version="7">You. Me. Bed. Now.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0232e1a2gc837g4fe4gab5dga00bcbfc41aa" version="7">Not so much. You spend the whole time avoiding swords and schemes. Plus people just get nastier as the night wears on.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1bb1471bg5e0eg4afeg8d1eg11a9f286e832" version="7">Enjoy the party. And enjoy so-and-so too, while you're at it. For now.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8e4aa382g84c7g417bg8920ga0655a4991e3" version="7">He's a good egg. A little scholarly for my tastes, but I'm sure you could crack his spine like a new book.</content>
  <content contentuid="h587ae24fgdbadg4a9ag9d9fg58acf741109f" version="7">All I need now is a fire-retardant lover to get lost in 'til sunrise.</content>

  <content contentuid="h650b1c44g1ff0g4f08g8fdag614276894e71" version="8">Thank you. I know it can't be easy.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1f4d92cfg4d17g447cgaccfg1f672a389ff6" version="7">High pain tolerance. And a dynamic duo of truly shitty bosses.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha5f5af01g94edg4bc9gaa23g22204b40e5b7" version="7">Bye, soldier.</content>
  <content contentuid="h72521999gd428g4e8dg9f42g8dfcc7d3afcd" version="8">Enjoy yourself tonight, Karlach.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf4dba7acg1cf5g458dga0a0g125b3dee2749" version="7">Good to see the two of you getting along, anyway. At least one of us is getting a little action.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdb68928fga404g462cgb0begf93ae4e593d7" version="7">I know. But you only live once, and if you never throw your dart, you'll never hit the bull's eye.</content>
  <content contentuid="h84245523g240eg4d6bga780ge67a4912edfc" version="7">It isn't hard. And I really like you. I was wrong to go for someone else.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcb24bbccg939bg4d1eg8b5bg854508e7743d" version="7">But hey. At least some of us are getting a little action.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0dd4fc13g660cg4ff1g9b7bgacba1cdabf54" version="7">It's nice to be somewhere where good is still &lt;i&gt;possible&lt;/i&gt;.</content>
  <content contentuid="h804ae105g02dfg48c5g8568ga834cc1d10a5" version="7">She's a funny one. All pointy and secretive, but it seems like there's someone very sweet beneath it all, you know?</content>
  <content contentuid="hd18ff525gbc99g4de4g9f2agba13b1c18b4c" version="7">I think I've drummed up the courage to tell you how much I like you.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd20963d7g55fdg4c6fga718gf6b68c95f420" version="7">Burn, baby. As hot as I can tolerate. Makes me a beast in battle. Hardly remember what I was like before it.</content>
  <content contentuid="he0cdf07bg645bg4295g87b7gfc5c699da968" version="7">Thank you for noticing.</content>
  <content contentuid="h47d3bf35g5962g4f07g9fb8g1f3dff6041bc" version="7">Really? I thought - because of you and you know... I don't know, I thought maybe you just wanted to be with someone you could actually &lt;i&gt;be &lt;/i&gt;with.</content>
  <content contentuid="hff408325g820bg4cafg854ag36024605644a" version="7">I still want to spend time with you - just the two of us.</content>
  <content contentuid="hbebe64e3g002fg4dd2g9707g07eee2e6d174" version="8">I know I was a little hopeless when we - you know - before. I want you to be happy. And I want you to be with someone you can actually &lt;i&gt;be &lt;/i&gt;with.</content>
  <content contentuid="hfc1cff4dge768g415dg9f69gc31db7e582a7" version="7">You have a mechanic for your heart?</content>
  <content contentuid="hdf17015cg8bf7g450bga993g34bdda594cbc" version="8">And with such lovely company.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc77490a8ge52eg4b0ega4e5gb170b81ca329" version="8">That's true. And I'm looking forward to spending more time with you.</content>

  <content contentuid="h5f6c3e00gdbaeg430ega9a2g20806c7198fa" version="7">&lt;i&gt;Gods&lt;/i&gt; that's hot. Don't get me started. I might never stop.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8491d7ccg23ddg46f5g937agca90ab6d93a3" version="7">Fuck yes! I'm celebrating my freedom. And our friendship. And these folks' bright future besides.</content>
  <content contentuid="hab466af6g6ad4g4a24g87c5g7770d93bc19a" version="7">And with good potations, too.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd0c50c7dgec88g4de8gb1bcg18f3e51c33de" version="7">Keep throwing.</content>
  <content contentuid="h60a54664g64b6g4f5eg8de8g45c3d31d1f4b" version="7">Oh god. You know I want that more than fucking &lt;i&gt;anything.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="h94129706g7bc3g4ad2g9052g79955da1d76f" version="8">Have fun.</content>
  <content contentuid="haa3038e8g8f5eg4bd7gab7fg8e069faee672" version="8">What'll happen if you don't get tuned up?</content>
  <content contentuid="h519da7ecgba82g4a66g9532g8bb7c90a66c0" version="7">Take you and Gale, for instance. Don't think I haven't noticed the sparks flying.</content>

  <content contentuid="hbcabb124g59d2g4cd0gabddg82b37e54437d" version="7">I met someone who might be able to help - a smith who worked in the Hells for a time.</content>

  <content contentuid="h5cd4480bg1f00g4fd4gb082g79a3e70f1221" version="7">Hear that? Infernal engine for a heart. Lets me burn as hot as the Hells. Seems to be running in overdrive since I left Avernus.</content>
  <content contentuid="hed891e4eg4b01g4258ga5e1g4d5a99a71ae7" version="7">You too, soldier. </content>
  <content contentuid="h17857cfeg779cg4de6g91e1g62284a6d680f" version="7">He's a good one. The best, maybe. When I think about what he sacrificed for me... Give him something to smile about, all right?</content>
  <content contentuid="h5a1c69fdg4493g4e3fgae7egc51092d52080" version="7">Well look, soldier, I won't always be too hot for words and deeds. You may regret to find that I happen to be very touch-worthy, underneath the searing, lethal flames.</content>
  <content contentuid="h669f3f5egfe03g45eag8d72g899470e3f24a" version="7">What does the engine allow you to do?</content>
  <content contentuid="h59bd7468g88ffg47e8g87b8gb307f654d2b9" version="7">Then we have you and Wyll, the ultimate incarnation of all things good in the world. There's something between you two, isn't there?</content>
  <content contentuid="h81490f17g6b33g416aga6d7g75f938bad7a4" version="7">Not if I enjoy you first.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4d54f75fg1a51g419dga818gf82b8ecb864b" version="7">You know there's someone else, Karlach.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdb502144g1cd4g4fbfg85eeg78ea3e522b51" version="7">Are you enjoying yourself?</content>
  <content contentuid="h49b77807g4e5eg4794gb456g364a7028ac9e" version="7">Enjoy yourself tonight, Karlach.</content>
  <content contentuid="h67359b00g7d61g4f3egaf5dgc7dd3b6440c3" version="7">I'd understand. I mean, I &lt;i&gt;do &lt;/i&gt;understand. I'm not possessive. And at the end of the day, I want you to do what you want to do.</content>
  <content contentuid="h42c804b6gf4b9g4e4dga15dg203eb27dbaa1" version="8">I want to be close to you. Now, ten minutes from now, ten years from now.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0bb6d7a8gf685g4d43gabb7g684b5bd4cb6c" version="8">I suppose so. But sometimes I feel like I'm stuck in the past.</content>
  <content contentuid="he68c2334ga685g47a2gb977g96e0b9e5a81a" version="7">Speaking of which... there's something I wanted to tell you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h80305c61g44c4g4509gbb81gdbda12363355" version="7">What does the engine allow you to do?</content>
  <content contentuid="h48346fbeg0b5eg43eaga572gbc204ec16cb5" version="7">Me too. I don't think I've ever looked forward to anything as much.</content>
  <content contentuid="h285cfb42ge989g4dbdgbdf0gd81d16c6a64e" version="7">Don't look too far back. We only just met.</content>
  <content contentuid="h698e4a42g33ebg4374gafbcg462460642b77" version="7">I appreciate that. But I'm afraid it's a miss this time.</content>
  <content contentuid="h46099074gca11g4913gbf6ege62b82d8a3d5" version="8">You better go enjoy the party before I do something I'll regret. I like you &lt;i&gt;un&lt;/i&gt;burnt, after all.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc3be4c8fg6aa1g41bag83b0g3ad351701792" version="6">Perhaps if I manage to break the curse... perhaps then I can show you just how grateful I am.</content>
  <content contentuid="h25539ecag9fc3g414agbe7bgd4fac1b410d2" version="6">I think I might be sick beyond the tadpole... I'm getting worried.</content>
  <content contentuid="h56671ba4gb791g42eeg923fgd389befbb73e" version="6">There's also the shadow curse - it's an affront and must be cleansed.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc3fd0824ge9f9g43a4g98e9g88d0514042c1" version="6">Why do you want to go to Moonrise Towers?</content>
  <content contentuid="haf8a3924gef2dg40e6ga7c1gde8dc1638ce8" version="6">Tell me how I can help.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3eadeaeeg54c0g47bag8f9cg2d1f9616e8b8" version="6">If only everyone said that.</content>
  <content contentuid="h422d4ff3g12b4g4098g86b6g4ef665dc49bb" version="6">How will the grove fare without you?</content>
  <content contentuid="h4cbf9238g4081g428fg83e0gfb6305fa7c9d" version="6">Don't get too sentimental - I had need of a guide in order to survive this curse.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf4abce35g0f2fg44c7g885ag10de999987f8" version="6">She can tend to the grove, help it heal. In time, others will join. Perhaps some day I can return.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5a14bf16gf773g4729g9587g75cb0818bf28" version="6">The Oak Father must have blessed you to make it this far, or another eye above.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc8cd9a3bg5939g44bfg8307g5300b87635fe" version="6">I have to ask - how do you know so much about the parasite?</content>
  <content contentuid="he9d3736fga766g4be5g92e5g29aadff8c821" version="6">Perhaps - if we can find Thaniel's lost half, and make him whole again.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd811a073gfd64g4d59gbaadgaa4e49bcd874" version="6">I need her to stay focused on her training - the grove will need a skilled healer in my absence. </content>
  <content contentuid="h2c62942ag070eg47a2g9a8fg61fe62c1cbb5" version="6">I found an elevator - but it leads right into the shadow curse.</content>
  <content contentuid="h22cf970cg1616g4b87gab5ege845a38d15e3" version="6">I'm glad I could help.</content>
  <content contentuid="h98668da7g99bcg4a40ga057g746dcd68d502" version="6">Sounds like the grove will be in good hands then.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7e4319aeg41aag47e3g871cgbfd07263e06e" version="6">Keep looking. If they're present, then it's likely there's a route to Moonrise somewhere.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha4725ec3g83d1g4b34g9a9cge4f6f3ce90f2" version="6">What about one of the others? Rath, perhaps?</content>
  <content contentuid="hb2fee860g0331g4b28gad80gdea1a70a9d1e" version="7">Perhaps I could share more than a camp fire and some company...</content>
  <content contentuid="hb6409eadgd1c6g4877g8a37gef68fa431e47" version="6">I knew something was wrong when he didn't wake up, but now I'm even more certain.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcaa02d93gf593g4afag9e65g80ab0c754515" version="6">Oak father's blessings to you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h16c9ca9eg68b9g4783g9b74g148b49140a50" version="6">We need to find Oliver and get him to return to Thaniel. Otherwise this curse will never be lifted.</content>
  <content contentuid="had28f1d3gd004g4cd0ga5acg4141897c4613" version="6">No more than my right hand can absorb my left. Oliver is helping Thaniel to recover; they both lie dormant, like trees awaiting spring. </content>
  <content contentuid="hb754f966g7c25g4a00g8d53g24f3126f7394" version="7">Still feeling at home here with us? The surroundings are less bucolic, I understand...</content>
  <content contentuid="hbac524f9g633dg40e1g9c28ga5e2f33e9630" version="6">I met a sort of shadow child before - a little boy named Oliver. Around Thaniel's age.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4f88e11eg0881g4ad3gb128gcb2e4ea42a62" version="6">Won't this cause resentment?</content>
  <content contentuid="hf045cd7dg31d1g4f82g89fdgf34c3a746c6d" version="6">I'm just glad to be out here amidst the Oak Father's creations.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9d25fe17gf0c1g48cbgb4c5g20fb931afce4" version="6">What now? You've got what you wanted, after all.</content>
  <content contentuid="h56e8924egff3dg4212g9774geaa144c48efa" version="6">It's both simple and not - we need to find Thaniel's missing half, and make him whole again. </content>
  <content contentuid="hc6db183dgf32cg4c45ga7f4gd12cde16980f" version="6">I'll be ready.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdd082dd4gba16g4c8cgad07g41d740c584f5" version="7">Well if there's anything I can do to make you &lt;i&gt;less &lt;/i&gt;comfortable, let me know.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2f1fd349g21adg44cdga03bgab7fd35a68e8" version="6">Perhaps... but best to not dwell on nights past. There are plenty more yet to come.</content>
  <content contentuid="h46f61d0ag939dg4686gb632g97674ba64426" version="6">Just try to make yourself useful.</content>
  <content contentuid="h092e92dfg0820g42a6g81fdg8884854e35f8" version="7">Prudent. But I hope we won't have to contend with the perils of the curse for long. There's more to living than just survival. Much more.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7c664d7eg3048g4365g80ceg4195e895d4da" version="6">Once the curse is lifted, they can stand as one or as a pair. Whatever they wish.</content>

  <content contentuid="h375542dbg5e97g41b8g8499gd68148fa8a81" version="6">Good lass. You're tougher than Blackwood.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6164d58ag9ab1g437agb483gc4c71a070a4d" version="6">Good lad. You're tougher than Blackwood.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2519156dga961g4d7egbe4bg0f641caec001" version="6">I swear I can already feel a change in the air - like the curse itself knows its time is short.</content>
  <content contentuid="h30ac00e4g4b9ag42f0g80cbg1c1dcc722fca" version="6">Hideous - but fascinating. Like nothing else in nature, I'm glad to say.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcc2b00e6geedcg4f2cg8bc3ga47a25fb6912" version="6">With such stimulating company? Never better.</content>
  <content contentuid="h32a5f5f7gd631g46b0g96b0g316305b945cf" version="6">Seems like you feel responsible for this shadow curse somehow...</content>
  <content contentuid="h2b5f1c3fg63c3g4c5ag9ff7gba90df2b5054" version="6">You'll find plenty of books before long. I keep coming across them everywhere. </content>
  <content contentuid="h9fd78d4fgc570g4779g933eg68ccf22e8047" version="6">I can't say for certain, but we'll see it come to pass long before this place recedes behind us. Don't worry - all is at hand. We can depart whenever you're ready.</content>
  <content contentuid="h68fa9a2ag30cbg4820g9303g2b8ea7e997be" version="6">I believe you when you tell me that your symptoms do not wholly align with the makings of the parasite. But until we remove it, I doubt we will be able to isolate the rest of your troubles.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdda39669gf868g415cg9a6cg717e7ad37f72" version="6">Miss it? Oh dear no. It's a terrible burden; takes you away from nature and forces you to deal with others' problems and personalities.</content>
  <content contentuid="h69dfa0e7g70a8g4b0dga1dcg641f92903947" version="6">Resentment will spring up like mushrooms no matter what I do. You cannot please everyone and you'd be a fool to try.</content>
  <content contentuid="he7d3ef0bgba6bg4ad3ga4c8g08aa2c9f6e7f" version="6">We must find Thaniel. He is the embodiment of nature's power, but... but he is just a child. A child who has been trapped in this place for a hundred years.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1c86ca4dgd0b0g49a1gb561gbb0983e8465e" version="6">In truth, I'm not sure. This is beyond all reckoning. It's still part of Thaniel, deep down, but it may not recognise that, or &lt;i&gt;want &lt;/i&gt;to recognise that.</content>
  <content contentuid="hbd0c8e56g74dag40c6gaff9gb7f8805efe0e" version="6">There'll be no firm answers until Moonrise Towers, I fear.</content>
  <content contentuid="hea916b0fg2032g4d06g8cfeg37f97fbb910b" version="7">I'd rather the shadow curse didn't linger just beyond the campfire... but your company more than makes up for it.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6fe97d14g6db5g448fgac5bg291236c29351" version="6">I'm glad. But let's keep focused at the same time.</content>
  <content contentuid="h15fd19e0gbd00g4bebgb541gc5ec69db2391" version="6">But... if I succeed, if I break the curse, then perhaps there will be time for myself again. And for others.</content>
  <content contentuid="h28ff3c8bg6250g470bg8b4cg0f481e3e2d3d" version="6">It may prove impossible to avoid the shadow curse entirely, but if you find any way to limit your exposure, seize it.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9c21a453ga966g42a5gbabbg0f7d3e94b568" version="6">Black outs, fainting spells. I'm losing new memories every day...</content>
  <content contentuid="h7dc8ecadg3bdcg418aga755g6157b6279268" version="6">One of those who died had a clue that was supposed to help us find the hidden entrance to the Underdark.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc61cff01g293dg4b72ga31bgc0a6f6c727f9" version="6">What stayed behind would have been the strongest part of him, but after all these years left in darkness, corruption must have taken hold.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9106cecdg217fg4b95gaff7g0a8c1768cb3f" version="6">But friendship is no consolation trophy. I cherish the bond we have forged. Whether it should grow into something else is not for me to predict.</content>
  <content contentuid="h50721cbdgf145g4c68g8306gc1df3aa71909" version="6">There are few things that are too strong for me. And cast those regrets aside; you did not get caught up in the moment - you seized it.</content>
  <content contentuid="hfdea42dbga304g4378g8db1g5fdf052e4436" version="6">Couldn't Nettie take over?</content>
  <content contentuid="hf70d1af2g42a2g4ac0ga19egbf78503055fc" version="6">Indeed, but we cannot yet say the same for you. I promised I would help you, and I intend to keep that promise, however I can.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf6fbc600ge2a7g41d6gaf9egb4debaa8427c" version="6">Aradin was convinced there was a hidden entrance in the temple of Selûne - I'd start there.</content>
  <content contentuid="h49422003g4357g49c1ga4eagca3898aab5e2" version="6">I've inspected a tadpole up close and seen the effects of them on the Absolute's so-called 'True Souls.'</content>
  <content contentuid="h6ce81ad3g7071g4463ga3a8gb984afce56ef" version="6">What about this secret stronghold in the Underdark? You must know more.</content>
  <content contentuid="h00498d17gcfd5g4fd5g8239gd717f601438a" version="6">If I can join you and get close to Moonrise, perhaps I can lift this curse just as you find a cure for your infection.</content>
  <content contentuid="h716a64e1g4e49g465eg982ag7de2e7828129" version="6">You wish to speak?</content>
  <content contentuid="h4d6060a7g44a7g4597g893eg0e50abe512f8" version="6">But in my eagerness, I put far too much faith in the abilities of Aradin and his band. We didn't even get close.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc61a4687gc302g4f6eg8e4dg1cd059379094" version="6">Join me.</content>
  <content contentuid="hef423700g0b7cg4db0g84d3g7f078d986b8b" version="6">I've got more exploring to do.</content>
  <content contentuid="h49e51b97g8ac5g419dg8b17gc808363ec832" version="6">Is that why you went with Aradin? You thought he might find this route to Moonrise?</content>
  <content contentuid="h5e5d6712gc2fcg466dg9c6agcd8671877ecd" version="6">By now, we should have seen some small glimmer of Thaniel's power - a sign that the land is healing. New growth, flowers in bloom. But there has been nothing.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3f4d756bg703ag4951gba98gd6d4169a3c4d" version="6">Maybe you could show your appreciation another way.</content>
  <content contentuid="he4fb1fcfgbebag4f3aga728g12ec0d1be849" version="6">What Ketheric Thorm unleashed is not something that nature can undo by itself. I must do what I can.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha0cafa12gf305g4008g804ag06928d94c003" version="6">What comes next will prove dangerous. Meet me by the shore outside Last Light - we can do our work there without imperilling others.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5642445bg14e1g43c0gaf89g3c983dbd01ba" version="7">I wish I could have found another fate for the Grove, but I appreciate all you have done for me nonetheless.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0e6c7cd5g0977g4c9egb037g3b0865a8e7eb" version="6">A bad impression? Impossible.</content>
  <content contentuid="h420960c9g21ccg48e5g8fafg45af11063be5" version="6">I met a sort of shadow child before - a little boy named Oliver. Around Thaniel's age.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8cd90deeg6530g4164g8320gf5255ed3ffd8" version="6">He's still fighting. The curse hasn't won yet, but he'll need our help if he's to recover.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4b51be9dg5c3eg4d8dg8bd5g8b2a3fa45317" version="6">A haunting has come upon you, but the first step is this admission you have now made. You will not walk alone into this night, remember that.</content>
  <content contentuid="h761c8aa3g26f3g4b0fg9ceege08891ccc4f8" version="6">Honestly? Let's just forget it ever happened.</content>
  <content contentuid="h78b31143g2d4eg404egbbb3g7a0551a9c47d" version="6">I'm glad to have you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5a96d3a3g4f33g41fdgb3fbg982cc5c90070" version="6">Thaniel is resting - but it's no easy slumber. I discovered what's wrong with him.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6eefc4a0g5afcg4a96g810fg6ac49629d41a" version="6">In other circumstances, I would have done the same.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4672d446gb2a1g4451g8fedga5a7a4a71175" version="6">I met a shadow child named Oliver, resembling Thaniel - but he's dead now.</content>
  <content contentuid="he07e4174g3c40g405fg8010gb37803e4b93a" version="6">The shadows rended him in two when they bore him away to the Shadowfell. Half of his essence remained here, amidst the curse. </content>
  <content contentuid="h40cb3c1dgf866g44e2g82ccgc63b9431c59b" version="6">Thaniel rests well. He's healing very rapidly, now that Oliver has returned to him.</content>
  <content contentuid="h48e237b5g7d9dg4773g8c60gaee946f87067" version="6">Those who remained are shadow-cursed. If you don't die at their hands, then you become one of them.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1082d626g0c43g462fgb41agf288c64fc996" version="6">What should I look for, exactly?</content>
  <content contentuid="haeced89cg26c5g4fd8g8fceg87d4c4c3c1e5" version="6">Rath has promise, but he's not ready yet. The grove needs experience and a strong hand.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1fecabf1g5b4bg4e89g9777g167b6298a79b" version="6">I studied one up close - closer than most would care to be to those things.</content>
  <content contentuid="h736febb1g98b0g4fe3g9c77ga512f2f31495" version="6">But if we can find him, we can break the curse. If you learn anything of the Shadowfell, or of a boy with the forest in his eyes, find me at once.</content>
  <content contentuid="h49586ddbgca9dg4847gb14cgfb17d46c282b" version="6">Look for signs of life in the darkness. Wildflowers, where everything else is dead. The curse cannot subdue the power Thaniel bears. Not entirely.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3e00a4abg4e52g4627gbb9agbcab82a20e56" version="6">What happened to Oliver, exactly? Did Thaniel... absorb him?</content>
  <content contentuid="h76f4410cg37c1g40c3gb368g20ebe9ecb8f2" version="6">Perhaps there's still a way to learn something from him - the dead can't deny their knowledge, if asked the right question.</content>
  <content contentuid="he3d1ee88ge896g4fd4ga3dbgb46d4f3cb6ea" version="6">Those illithid creatures threaten the natural order - it's my duty to do what I can to stop them.</content>
  <content contentuid="hedf2fb28g327dg44eeg9f60g25c6e76b45d0" version="6">This doesn't have to be your burden alone. Every moment counts, and I've asked much of you already without being at your side.</content>
  <content contentuid="h360c3b30ga2c3g44edg8415gd645259ddd45" version="6">And I am glad to be at your side. I just hope an old bear can prove to be of some service to you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7518d6cfgf223g4fa3gab0fg61ac357dfbee" version="6">What now? You've got what you wanted, after all.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1d1cae15gada9g4434g8455gb206020e0b8f" version="6">That sounds like what you need. But the next part of the journey mightn't be straightforward - or safe.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7a62d4a1gcb48g46a5g956eg2253bdee200c" version="6">I found the stronghold in the Underdark you mentioned - a place called Grymforge.</content>
  <content contentuid="haf587a86g7a1bg409aga255gdf27df1e80b5" version="7">The shadow curse is upon us. As foul as I remember it - perhaps even worse.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc26ba74eg5684g4ac0g951eg89a281b28e27" version="7">There is a ruin, some way outside of Last Light. I caught a glimpse of fresh blooms there, but did not investigate further. I shall mark it upon your map.</content>
  <content contentuid="h98807efcg599bg43f8ga0d0g204e11de0a0c" version="6">Don't worry - if you find something, you will know it.</content>
  <content contentuid="h724a9387g7fc2g4c2dgb508gafa1cf3d6b0b" version="6">I helped overthrow Ketheric Thorm and his Dark Justiciars years ago. But I failed to prevent him from unleashing darkness across the region before he was defeated.</content>
  <content contentuid="h27cb0cfcg46c3g475fg9531g6b949d63ac16" version="6">Try as I may, I cannot stop thinking about death.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd097cd8fgce56g4c59g918cgfbad0fbf1f12" version="6">What will happen to the grove now?</content>
  <content contentuid="h02723b95gb304g4e49gb6aag5e38bd3a1c0d" version="6">No, my friend. The only thing I ask of you is to allow me by your side on the road ahead. I still owe you a debt, and I intend to pay.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4925af6fg97e0g4a33g83cdgdf69eb014e43" version="6">Perhaps so, or perhaps not. I had wondered if I had detected something else once... but I must have been mistaken - my admiration for you, conflated with other feelings.</content>
  <content contentuid="h53a11e3dga4a9g4e16g8734gc12eb4a20b01" version="6">And you saw this boy yourself? That can't be a coincidence - but we need to be sure.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0d7efb86g5e59g4ac9ga6f5g7c1075742c30" version="6">A &lt;i&gt;survivor? &lt;/i&gt;Silvanus blesses us - this could be just the person we need to speak to.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdba266b6g1195g4353gb391g12cf24ca0219" version="6">What now? You've got what you wanted, after all.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha3ae013ag9b43g4707g8575gc944463774e1" version="6">Very shrewd of you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h36923cd2g21c1g4416g8842gc9f8611c97e6" version="6">Good. Now our roots can deepen - together.</content>
  <content contentuid="hef73916ageac7g4a4cgaa57g555d10ea864f" version="6">Seems your ranks are quite packed. If some space frees up, I'll be ready for you.</content>
  <content contentuid="hec66459dgf45cg41efgb635g35b4163b7c2c" version="6">This land is more than just soil and rock, root and leaf... it is a living being, in the form of a young fey boy, with the forest itself in his eyes. His name is Thaniel - I've met him, in my meditations. </content>
  <content contentuid="h6e6cb0ffg6db7g40e2g8888g605ea8e88b9d" version="6">Perhaps not - if he truly is a part of Thaniel, then he is beyond life and death. More likely he's just hiding. We should return to where you saw him.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd3c055d6gcd81g4338g9e7ag4f6b85c6d44c" version="6">&lt;i&gt;Leave.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="h1de2636ag3683g4952gb2a4ga13ca2e5969d" version="7">In fact, I saw just the sort before, not long after we first came within reach of the shadow curse. Fool that I am, I did not grasp their significance at the time.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc0efd937g8509g4ff1g95b7g00ff77623538" version="6">I'll trust your judgement.</content>
  <content contentuid="h498718afg5541g4fc7ga12bg60700e494178" version="6">The grove needs to move beyond the mistakes of the past. What it needs is an unknown quantity; an outsider who can enforce the Oak Father's teachings without bias.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1441a46bge622g486cg9ca2g99dfc5ce77b9" version="6">More good has been done since I met you than in a hundred years before. Words cannot express my gratitude.</content>
  <content contentuid="h655a2b64g5236g46beg9e4bgfa7bebb8d576" version="6">Sleepwalking... hallucinating creatures... the temptations... I could lose myself before I make it to a cure.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd7892868ga893g481agb945g68dbacab9388" version="6">At the celebration before - I may have came over too strong perhaps. Got caught up in the moment.</content>
  <content contentuid="h63077166g82e4g4e1bgadc4gfc33706a9147" version="6">I shall do my utmost.</content>
  <content contentuid="he085ec94g89d6g4429g910ag055b0d9d116c" version="6">Danger. Are you sure that's the best way to Moonrise?</content>
  <content contentuid="hfff91df5g632dg4a00gbcb2g46a94f965ab5" version="7">Is that so? Well, nature does abhor waste... I will keep watch, thank you. I had a feeling time in your company would prove fruitful.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2d25e5e9gbec5g45d0g9187g95b2dd7c7fce" version="6">No matter how it's been twisted by the shadows, it is still part of Thaniel's essence - it will resemble him somehow, and may show signs of his power.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd8dde8fag6012g4fc3gbb57g6357a9cc0a70" version="6">A drow attacked me and I defended myself. Afterwards, I was able to examine the tadpole that emerged.</content>
  <content contentuid="h199075a6g579cg419ag9fcagf456eef43def" version="6">I am here to be your ear, as you bear your burdens, and the arms that protect you, if you can shoulder them no more.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0d1d56d2geb32g450ag80cfgd553b067b8d1" version="6">Only, the missing half may not come willingly. The curse will have sunk its tendrils deep, twisting Thaniel's essence into something... else.</content>
  <content contentuid="h940728b3g9a51g4ae6ga2c2gaf904e0ffab4" version="6">I can't be exact, unfortunately. Time and the shadow curse won't have been kind to any traces that would have been left behind.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf1d3e576g22f8g4fbbg81afg764a8927aef8" version="6">Once Thaniel's essence is found, what then?</content>
  <content contentuid="h9ae4d80fgfd5eg47e2g8d2fg69c073ec0a11" version="6">Tread carefully. You're on the right track, I'm sure - but there'll still be danger and difficulty before you reach Moonrise.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf5a97d44gce75g40a8gaebeg91e145f9ca3f" version="6">I can think of a thing or two... but in truth, it is for the best that the curse consumes my thoughts for now. This is the best chance I've had in a century - I cannot squander it.</content>
  <content contentuid="h8c97aaa8gd0b6g4179g81f3g46f6bde4fd81" version="6">You're still faring well at camp, I hope?</content>
  <content contentuid="h9cfe3429gb21bg4d75g99c1gf968bf5fccbc" version="6">Let me help you then. Every moment counts, and I've asked much of you already without being at your side.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf16e4f16g2552g4864g9f8egbf6184914de7" version="6">Not what. &lt;i&gt;Who.&lt;/i&gt; But all in due course.</content>
  <content contentuid="h70ce430cg2fb0g4d51ga031gf99655b6bd09" version="6">You're sending me to look for a needle in a haystack. In the dark.</content>
  <content contentuid="h31f72c09g80d8g4e17gbeb1g91ce53e6c91e" version="6">First and only Druid. What will Francesca even do here?</content>
  <content contentuid="h8a4bb07bgfc95g433fgb396g392e4d716560" version="6">At the celebration with the tieflings before - I hope I didn't come over too strong. Got caught up in the moment.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3152a775g6679g4457gb74cgfb9e26c255d4" version="6">What now? You've got what you wanted, after all.</content>
  <content contentuid="h622a5571gf38cg423fg8572g2230ec173b98" version="6">Absolute followers - but that's about all.</content>
  <content contentuid="haf448af8g84bdg4173gbd7fgfd6565713b70" version="6">I'll see what I can do, but no promises.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc2387ecfg8dd8g4f4bg98b1g1d1060f67097" version="7">But with the Oak Father's blessing, we may soon see it banished from these lands.</content>
  <content contentuid="h318a2ed6gb1f1g46bdg9bf2g2cc664a94e59" version="6">A fellow druid. I can count on her to tend to the grove in my absence, help it heal.</content>
  <content contentuid="h30c2edb8g1efbg4556g9ebcg343d0848b27d" version="6">It is lost to me - lost to the world. Perhaps there'll be some way to unseal it in the future...</content>
  <content contentuid="h0265f08fgac89g4630g8e9dg4803fbacc3d8" version="6">&lt;i&gt;Share what you learned of Thaniel's presence in the Shadowfell.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="hbc2805c8g4c0ag491bgb5aag08a739cc9b97" version="6">Friends and nothing more, then?</content>
  <content contentuid="h88cf1340g4db8g43c6g9531g01f2664dff34" version="6">Perhaps it can be reasoned with, but I'm not hopeful. Reason is not something that thrives amidst the shadow curse.</content>
  <content contentuid="h91149ce1g2594g45a1g99f3g81f6ee826efd" version="6">Still, I would like to return here some day. See Thaniel and Oliver again - in my meditations, or perhaps in person, if the Oak Father wills it. I hope he does.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9d6d1aa3g4926g40fcgbc03gcdd370805b7e" version="6">Well... there's hardly anyone left to share the responsibility with. Few who witnessed the fall of Moonrise still draw breath.</content>

  <content contentuid="h76c14529gedc8g4764gbaa3g6f3a40544b08" version="6">Powerful, certainly. But clearly arrested by magic, too. The question I just can't answer is &lt;i&gt;who &lt;/i&gt;has done this. And why?</content>
  <content contentuid="h344bbf86g9d95g4f1eg9117g7656a76f8130" version="6">If you want me, I'm yours. Against the curse, against the Absolute - anything. Just say the word.</content>

  <content contentuid="hcc718a88g3042g4666g9820g92ccdf31489f" version="6">You're right. I'll try to keep it together.</content>

  <content contentuid="h0ec8fca3g648cg44c0g97eag1ddffa95b06d" version="6">...Forgive me. Sometimes I forget myself, gazing on the beauty of nature's creations.</content>

  <content contentuid="h9d5618a8g2ed9g453fg8416gbe6a3bb6efba" version="6">...perhaps not. I do not know. All I can do for now is to try do some good where I can - try to help you.</content>
  <content contentuid="h55434507g9414g45d8gba04g861d2a682612" version="6">Yes. I think you do...</content>

  <content contentuid="h7460cf7fgbe7dg4920ga2c8gcc269d518bbe" version="6">I can think of a thing or two... but the curse grips my mind for now, and I would loathe to give you only part of my attention.</content>
  <content contentuid="h729eae8fg0c83g4a26gb63bgf89a563f0dcb" version="6">This shadow curse you spoke of... surely it can't be &lt;i&gt;that &lt;/i&gt;bad.</content>
  <content contentuid="h46106ae4gadaag4a89g996ag9d7780b3d992" version="6">No. At least, not right now.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7a8c6dabg17b3g4c05gbd9ege1c1fa8b5e45" version="6">So when will the curse actually be lifted?</content>
  <content contentuid="h5975f70ega2bcg4dfbgab8agd6fe135bd453" version="6">You've been researching the illithid parasites - is there anything you can tell me?</content>
  <content contentuid="he58bbbd1g0e0fg4095ga35dgac8e9be21c88" version="6">How do you know this?</content>
  <content contentuid="h8e476765g938dg4a08gbeb0gd1bdcc86db01" version="6">Perhaps, but we'll need to get closer before I can put my theory into practice.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6be945e8g073eg40e6g87dbg1b482a88ae19" version="6">I met a sort of shadow child before - a little boy named Oliver. Around Thaniel's age.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc3b602c8gaf19g42a5ga2a3gce48c19c78a1" version="6">I'm sure something will come to me, given time.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf8b872d4g402ag49b1ga756g3ffd1ea6e4c1" version="6">Good - this is what we've been lacking. Now there's a chance we can find Thaniel, and bring him home.</content>
  <content contentuid="h69066e34g6455g494fg932bga11e7d369d1f" version="6">I have. But perhaps there is more that I want... </content>
  <content contentuid="hbc9b3a81g8618g4a60g9f3bg41d81eeec126" version="6">I'm certain. The Underdark is dangerous, yes, but the alternative is suicide. Be patient and be thorough - the path will reveal itself in time.</content>
  <content contentuid="h365e49fegfc9eg4eceg94b1gb40aeb81122b" version="6">Wonderfully! If I'm honest, the grove was too comfortable for my tastes; I felt removed from nature.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9a13dd3agc5bbg4705gb4b4g75ca3f471ff5" version="6">Precisely. Then perhaps I could have done something about both the shadow curse and ceremorphosis aberrations.</content>
  <content contentuid="hcbae6dd1g2327g403fga9cfgdee000fd7ea7" version="6">Oak Father shield you, my friend.</content>
  <content contentuid="h28fc60d0gab2fg4783g8aa6g63e89948ca1d" version="6">A living witness is unlikely, I'll admit. But perhaps there'll be an &lt;i&gt;unliving &lt;/i&gt;witness, or some lingering echo of what we seek. </content>
  <content contentuid="hb32c9482gff7cg4b40g898eg61a8016ea3d3" version="6">There's a Flaming Fist recuperating in Last Light. Seems he escaped from the curse - and he spoke of a boy called Thaniel.</content>

  <content contentuid="hdde92fb1gf1c3g440dg8d97gfc8230a758c2" version="6">I'm glad I didn't leave a bad impression then.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2397f9c7gad2bg4d1eg91b9ga2acde450b3b" version="6">Indeed. </content>
  <content contentuid="h3df64ccfgb7b8g4772g9425g0af3fa33e45e" version="6">...But since the curse was unleashed, I have not felt his presence. He is its prisoner, I fear. And as long as he remains so, his domain will lie in darkness.</content>
  <content contentuid="h23448ec9g026bg4918g9a4bg07de0b0705d2" version="6">How is Thaniel?</content>
  <content contentuid="hdcd96fceg1b6fg483bga3f2gde0806980ce3" version="6">I'll miss my books, but I can find all the wisdom they contain out here, first-hand.</content>

  <content contentuid="h23e088d8gf9aag49a9gb3f3g2e7003323e99" version="7">I can only imagine what fate would I have met without you -rotting in the goblins' cells? Being sealed away by the Rite of Thorns for all eternity?</content>
  <content contentuid="hfa8c9aeagbaeag40b1gb9eag7fca9c5378ce" version="6">Be wary of anyone who actually &lt;i&gt;wants &lt;/i&gt;such a role, I say. Likely they don't understand it, or they have ill intent.</content>
  <content contentuid="h6009fbc6g2adcg4a90gb315g8af412c8a05c" version="6">If I had my fleet of druids and a month of hard research, perhaps I could help. But I'm no savant, for now I can only guarantee a cure for ceremorphosis.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2ebb41deg13dfg483cg9040g4e932e4dd6e3" version="7">These lands must bring back bad memories for you. I hope you're still faring all right with us.</content>

  <content contentuid="h6f46892dg304bg459cga2dcg6b16a706ea90" version="6">What now? You've got what you wanted, after all.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7c961179gb38fg4c94g8cf7g762acbf83358" version="6">I knew I could put my faith in you. If only we had met sooner.</content>
  <content contentuid="h229098eagec9bg41c8g8ef5g9481d63b1111" version="6">Precious little, but I'm quite certain it can still be found.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3ebfc133g4af8g41f4g9395g2f58b512989f" version="6">Do you know how the shadow curse can be stopped?</content>
  <content contentuid="h2cce0cf1ga724g4bd9g871bg90c9a56bb63b" version="6">A dwarf called Brian, I believe. Though there's no guarantee that the goblins left him recognisable.</content>

  <content contentuid="h63d23bd5g9400g4f3eg8720g5ca46ed593bd" version="6">I hope they will remain as a pair. It would be good for them both to have a friend, once I'm gone.</content>

  <content contentuid="h768ef52dg69b1g4a4fgb5a1gd802c13d617b" version="3">Because it is slow and stupid and sleeping. Ah - Boo says Minsc should phrase this in a kinder fashion.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2a6d2ba5ga32dg44b4g910eg2ab090970722" version="3">You are sure? And you could not have told me this before?</content>
  <content contentuid="hced61a45g348bg41d1gbb7egfdedfa40ad6d" version="3">Minsc may have been mistaken. Boo presents compelling evidence that Astarion may in fact be a vampire.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3acf7160gfa6eg4ee6gbcbfg438bd5dfdf73" version="3">Not just safe - she is among friends. Minsc is her friend, you are her friend, and most important of all, Boo is her friend.</content>

  <content contentuid="hd6f3c49bg8e94g4e00gb357g2eb25b2337ef" version="3">And in the meantime, Boo shall watch her like a tiny wingless hawk.</content>
  <content contentuid="h03d06f56g17d8g4bd6g81c5g585181f686d1" version="3">But for all his betrayings of Karlach, Gortash never for a moment &lt;i&gt;bested her&lt;/i&gt;.</content>
  <content contentuid="h468bc1a6g23eeg4fc0gb964g60358a89b05a" version="3">How are you and Gale getting along?</content>
  <content contentuid="hb9dd5876g47fcg4628gba6dg5b929586d34d" version="3">We share an enemy right now, but... you're right. Shadowheart is evil.</content>
  <content contentuid="h966abc7cg8363g46b1gbf31gdec7de447e33" version="3">She hated the city at first. Too busy, she said, too noisy. Too many people. </content>

  <content contentuid="h6f621ff4gc803g42e7ga2c0g030ef6177bd1" version="3">And failing that - to end his madness with the cleansing blade.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0647a048g5d85g4c3ag829cgaf77a9466a63" version="3">Or perhaps the night is too large to burn. I do not know. But I do know that I am angry.</content>

  <content contentuid="h717b6c7dg46dcg4aa7gab10g159e87697957" version="3">Boo is correct. No beard! There are more whiskers on his tiny face than on the mighty chin of Minsc!</content>

  <content contentuid="hce94f1b6g69d1g4521gae8cg0c44c43ba9ce" version="3">Don't mock, Minsc. It's killing her.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc3d65c3bgc66cg465fg9946g3d57b1720f37" version="3">Exactly so - and the illithids are our true enemies. If Boo must choose which enemy to fight - it will be fish eye he dines on first, not that of any githyanki.</content>
  <content contentuid="h64c289aagf69fg46b4gb86bgde549f9563e9" version="3">My friend...? You &lt;i&gt;saved&lt;/i&gt; my oldest and best and oldest friend from the shadow lands.</content>
  <content contentuid="hddadac2eg02f8g4235g8ab4gc65614cd3584" version="3">I do not know all of those words, but it is clear that Boo likes Shadowheart best of all.</content>
  <content contentuid="h70529d5ega190g49a7gb71dg8223bc19dc07" version="3">The city still clings to the hill, the sea still stretches on forever. And the stench of evil still makes Boo wish for a tiny peg on his nose.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3aee343cg6a6cg4b7dgb11eg41f8f1f1facb" version="3">I speak with animals - why can't I understand him?</content>
  <content contentuid="ha5cd29e3g8e9ag4168ga715gcb29d7fc54f4" version="3">Minsc politely disagreed. Dynaheir was dead, and so his dajemma could never be done.</content>
  <content contentuid="h971f403bg6a00g405dga364g7ab862110f6b" version="3">What did he do to upset you?</content>
  <content contentuid="hc3268b2cga7d3g44e2g83d9gc52113af8a5b" version="3">Boo says it was perhaps a den of denial rather than a den of evil. Minsc says one thing is very much like the other.</content>
  <content contentuid="h42b4f76fg4fa8g4071gbbd4g5c7f962758f8" version="3">Of course. It was a splendid adventure.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2d337d33gf0aag4a0cgb399g77868f0006ec" version="3">And Lae'zel is my wychlaran!</content>
  <content contentuid="hb7554d6dg9b0cg46ddg9069ge3f2ffd2dc67" version="3">If you wish to know the answer to that, ask a statue.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha02eab41gf2acg4bf0gbb3cg8847df9fc7c3" version="3">I do not wish to speak of the wizard.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdf0ef30eg669dg49a1g912fgd21b7ec7e874" version="3">We're allies - nothing more.</content>
  <content contentuid="he35c7913g9f85g4471gbdcbg58ea1be40a75" version="3">We haven't known each other long - but I think I would like to be more than friends.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1f51dcb0g755dg4753g9f11gb001d95e4fe0" version="3">And Minsc did not mean to say so, no more than he is a hathran of his high country! </content>
  <content contentuid="h2d31e1cagdbc0g429eg9eb4g457ea736898c" version="3">Never! If he is not careful, Boo will shred his books and use them as bedding!</content>
  <content contentuid="hda2e0784g0794g4399g91f0ge581376ef110" version="3">It is a phrase in the old tongue of Rashemen - meaning 'blunt blade'.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha6771df6gf27fg49d4gbd1fgdb61dd8ba4d8" version="3">Ahh! You speak of Minsc's misshapen skull? It is true, I once suffered a most heroic head-wound.</content>
  <content contentuid="h3c0d0d03gc9a8g4c8ag9bd0gc06132182de5" version="3">After wandering a ways, and some savings of the Sword Coast, Minsc returned to Rashemen. To find a welcome fit for hamsters and heroes!</content>
  <content contentuid="h8f4334d3g0e92g45ceg9ac5g3a167bb3a91b" version="3">Indeed! A berserker after my own heart. Though hers is made of hellish heat, and metal, and... some manner of coin-operated device?</content>
  <content contentuid="h4936175dge3dag4778gaefdg4d9b30f35323" version="3">Who is Halsin?</content>
  <content contentuid="h0f4fc425g9e2cg4120gbbbag83fe3717e15f" version="3">But if Minsc can become calm, perhaps evil will learn to fear his serenity.</content>
  <content contentuid="hafcdb790g19b1g4ff1g87d3g89e429271289" version="3">You'll like him - he reminds me of you a little.</content>
  <content contentuid="h49dafbc3gb256g4f6dg822cg8fe56fad079d" version="3">That is why Minsc always speaks his mind. LOUDLY.</content>
  <content contentuid="hd1f842a5gbf10g4d49g8e21ge120539ee387" version="3">Talk about something else.</content>
  <content contentuid="hba6e9707g559cg450bg921ag3e1c009b1fd0" version="3">Boo speaks of much - perhaps, one day, &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt; will be ready to listen.</content>
  <content contentuid="he33b550fg2ec7g40dbgbe81gaef9107a000a" version="3">...I know you mean well, my friend. But Boo, being &lt;i&gt;your&lt;/i&gt; friend, wishes to share some of this cold and pointy truth I mention.</content>
  <content contentuid="h733139f9g80beg43bbgbc7fg334210bfa1fe" version="3">There is power in the wychlaran bond. Far too much to be wasted on weeping. To use that power to serve the living does not sully the dead - it honours them.</content>
  <content contentuid="h55ee22b2g7847g4559gaa69g0fd26275485e" version="3">And Minthara is - eh. A friend of yours, I am sure.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc8a30e74gc20fg46c1ga5bbgc6f826829484" version="3">I tell you, he grew pale as death itself. He licked his lips, and trembled so violently that Minsc thought he might faint on the spot!</content>
  <content contentuid="h74146614ge448g49b0ga01dg0c3bbb130704" version="3">But it is &lt;i&gt;like&lt;/i&gt; the city too. Here, it is loud with the daily wailing of people. In Rashemen, it is also loud - &lt;i&gt;if &lt;/i&gt;you know where to listen.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7764b711gdf0bg4353gacbdga449f735ec7a" version="3">As you wish. Boo? Do you have much to say on the matter of 'something else'?</content>
  <content contentuid="hec06b1f6gff38g4c6bg9027g7ba9ba21258f" version="3">&lt;i&gt;Evil&lt;/i&gt; is my enemy - and I have two boots. One can stomp righteously on Sharran skulls while the other kicks the Absolute about the place.</content>
  <content contentuid="he19ba3e4g411bg448dg8b51g740d82ff6062" version="3">This is why Boo favours the spot just above my buttocks.</content>
  <content contentuid="h04f02af2gb357g4cadgac61ged4d4f6a14cd" version="3">Correct! There are more whiskers on Boo's tiny face than on the mighty chin of Minsc!</content>
  <content contentuid="h8201cfe2g234eg40degbd14g4954f57509c2" version="3">So be like Boo, and fight with the weapons nature gave you.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf2501c47g5e57g4fa4gac4agecb512a396f1" version="3">You're a true warrior, Minsc - you don't need a petty thing like &lt;i&gt;weapons.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="h315d3671g59a2g463fg9e64g514421a2ab01" version="3">It was only polite for Minsc to agree. </content>
  <content contentuid="hd3ee0bc3g56ccg4b2eg8608g96eb6d27e4b6" version="3">Aw. Do you see? This is the manner of compliment that only good friends pay to one another!</content>
  <content contentuid="hd297674bg50a4g4eb4gb9b6g2310167ab58c" version="3">You travelled a hundred years in a moment - what do you make of this new world?</content>
  <content contentuid="h10c47cf8g0484g495cgb263g3d63e41e7449" version="3">A fabulous tattoo.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9f4eac80gfb81g42b3g9b04g9e51d3296559" version="3">What is your fondest memory of adventuring with Bhaalspawn?</content>
  <content contentuid="h86245a55g6bc4g40e2ga38dg1ff8485c4507" version="3">Eh, Boo has said it is unkind to speak behind the backs of some of our companions.</content>
  <content contentuid="hce75cba3g6e4fg4929gbff1gd9bd73cc2a73" version="3">Well. In many ways, it is the very opposite of this city. The far side of Faerûn, with empty plains, white forests, and peaks that pierce the very belly of the sky!</content>
  <content contentuid="h382acbcbg427cg4493g819eg1fe9a7a53fe4" version="3">To each &lt;i&gt;wychlaran&lt;/i&gt; is bonded a berserker bodyguard. To dog her heels and watch her back, until death claims one or both.</content>
  <content contentuid="h91b8ecccg2050g4833ga4ebg84fb06c6a238" version="3">Jaheira says Minsc and Boo were often draped in flowers, and showered with wine. Still as stone, but the life of the party nonetheless!</content>
  <content contentuid="h55214525g8ba8g44bfg9680g860a398a4c2e" version="3">Boo is here. My steel is here. Jaheira's face has more lines, but her tongue and wits are as sharp as ever.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7192acdfg34fdg41abgabfcga8e46718d5ed" version="3">Maybe someday you'll trust me enough to tell the real tale.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf6743bb0g406cg4dfcgb230gdd72cf56f2f6" version="3">&lt;i&gt;Minsc &lt;/i&gt;says that you are perhaps not as righteous or sweet-smelling as you believe.</content>
  <content contentuid="he09fe887g0641g4b69g836dgb3cc99678c51" version="3">I just need to know you're going to listen to her from now on. To me.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1c341442g97d2g4bbegab92ge4df2223b28d" version="3">If my meaning is not clear... just check under your boot.</content>
  <content contentuid="h964d6d6bgce8eg47a6ga525g2bfbb40ea1cc" version="3">I don't think all of the Sharrans were evil - some were just misguided.</content>
  <content contentuid="hefac9ab6geb52g4089ga2f7gdf61863f8700" version="3">You can admit it. You're not a &lt;i&gt;little&lt;/i&gt; bit jealous of his legend?</content>
  <content contentuid="h85896c2fg5000g43d3g8d92gc5ac4f304873" version="3">Soft-spoken. Hates curses. Loves trees.</content>
  <content contentuid="h98268a15g9ae6g415bgb3f2g07489ea3eb16" version="3">Somehow such a person as you describe has entirely escaped Minsc's notice. How strange.</content>
  <content contentuid="h50e06c7cg7217g41bfgbf88g844636092220" version="3">Ahh, you come in search of stories? It is not yet time to tuck Boo in for the night - but very well!</content>
  <content contentuid="ha65f6f0fg73ddg4fdega046gebccb8a41f72" version="3">You're both giant, hulking do-gooders. I thought you'd get along.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf57bb65fg74e8g411dgb7bdgc447925b227a" version="3">If such a tiny puny druid-man reminds you of Minsc, I think the tadpole may have made a feast of your brain!</content>
  <content contentuid="h4d6331c7g4f52g42f2g93a1g88f32b1cec46" version="3">Boo and I, we thank you for your kind words, my friend. But Minsc knows when he has made a mess that is for him, and him alone to clean.</content>
  <content contentuid="he559b94dg6783g4ad5g9206g3e93e8b0474d" version="3">Your gaze is naturally caught on my handsome face - the face that is loved by all - but cast your eyes down. Just a little. Not so far as to make Minsc blush.</content>
  <content contentuid="h74cb32d4g8087g4ffdgb015ge43e3fd45a5e" version="3">The Boot of Backsides, perhaps? Or - </content>
  <content contentuid="h38e8c1b7g4200g4b83g9928g8c9068ca7995" version="3">The telthors: guardian spirits of every root, rock, and tree. Here in the Sleeping Lands they are silent - but in the far north, they know how to speak still.</content>
  <content contentuid="h036fcaeeg39a5g4014g949dgd6e8813ad5f2" version="3">My people know of your berserkers, too. They make for fine and challenging prey.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha3288575g3cb6g4a97gab52g10cab402e6f4" version="3">&lt;i&gt;Leave.&lt;/i&gt;</content>
  <content contentuid="hb90e12fcgcf27g4b2egbfbbg6c1ae5effcdb" version="3">I think I understand your meaning. Then Jaheira &lt;i&gt;is&lt;/i&gt; my wychlaran - and so are &lt;i&gt;you&lt;/i&gt;. You are my wychlaran!</content>
  <content contentuid="he55d3b8eg6439g4d45gb398g0c45f280ecfd" version="3">How did you come to trust the spawn of such an evil god?</content>
  <content contentuid="h096cda74g25f9g4d8cgb461gc7df82caf815" version="3">That's what I said.</content>
  <content contentuid="h265b0763gf6abg4ed8gbad2gc1fcc1a1dbbd" version="3">Hah - well, may he answer to the archdevil herself, and may all her questions be hot pokers pressed against his flesh!</content>
  <content contentuid="h7290fd92gd997g4d7cga60cg71048ce3f16e" version="3">The githyanki may have Minsc of Rashemen's ire; sometimes, healthy servings of his sword; but for this, and this alone, they shall always have his &lt;i&gt;respect&lt;/i&gt;.</content>
  <content contentuid="hbb2f53e0g326bg4723g88c6g6f3c95dada81" version="3">Let's talk about something else.</content>
  <content contentuid="h90792ee1g146cg420fg801egce79478753ba" version="3">Enough joking. Does the hamster actually speak to you?</content>
  <content contentuid="hec83729cg77feg4b67g84b7g32c54af3c36e" version="3">Can you not? Do you not see his noble bearing? The deep wells of wisdom that are his eyes? </content>
  <content contentuid="h5d36095ag13a2g4792g8a0eg219bc814ef8d" version="3">You suggest that Minsc uses the term lightly? Simply leaps from Dynaheir to Jaheira, with no caring for the custom itself? An unworthy thought - and WRONG!</content>
  <content contentuid="hcc0a8327g9ff8g4b56g961fg4c33afb6693e" version="3">And Gale is my wychlaran!</content>
  <content contentuid="h13bd0b38g8815g4e5ega686gd26c25c71947" version="3">You chased after me, time and again, and saved me when you did not even know me - we are &lt;i&gt;already&lt;/i&gt; 'more than friends'.</content>
  <content contentuid="h76edac4eg7343g46degbb40gc3bf7544e0a6" version="3">I had hoped we had grown a little closer than that.</content>
  <content contentuid="hfcfa5ee0gc6e8g4089g938bgf3f6c94dc4a9" version="3">You travelled with Bhaalspawn before, didn't you? What do you know of them?</content>
  <content contentuid="hc2aa3f37g71dag4933g97f8gf6d46291c50d" version="3">It's simple - the end justifies the means.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf48c573fgb993g470cg98e5gc4582090c656" version="3">Minsc is an open book, with many pretty pictures.</content>
  <content contentuid="ha4e6ed82geb24g411agb9cdg9e451311bad4" version="3">The first time - my &lt;i&gt;dajemma.&lt;/i&gt; A warrior's quest of proving. Minsc quickly proved that quests do not always go as the stories say.</content>
  <content contentuid="h2a7669aag37e7g46f0g834agf526f4d271a8" version="3">It sounds like an amazing place. Why did you ever leave?</content>
  <content contentuid="hfc5b6fdagdf6bg4d61ga08dg64a0c7130c77" version="3">Of the drow I can say only this - she may be treacherous, vicious, and much meaner than she has any need to be. But she is clearly no cleverer than Minsc.</content>
  <content contentuid="he16bb935gf700g4577gb348g25d074799e9d" version="3">Just last night, Minsc was dressing one of his many heroic wounds in camp - when Astarion stumbled upon the scene.</content>
  <content contentuid="he5b57536g1ee0g495cg9d2eg138ed508a158" version="3">You do not know this custom? Great Rashemen is ruled by the Masked Ones - wise women you might call 'witches'.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9dde1687ge9e4g4805gbfe7g85bb54bb1028" version="3">Not minding is one of the many things Minsc is known for!</content>
  <content contentuid="h78eefbfdg7e33g4bbdgafe6g6b97416b3330" version="3">You are of the same blood as our old friend: a Bhaalspawn, and as close to Minsc as if they were his own kin. </content>
  <content contentuid="h2d819244gac61g46f2g8388gf1ed7c8f4b85" version="3">You inspired people even as a statue.</content>
  <content contentuid="h06007d5ag1d25g495bgbec2g15e8406d27b6" version="3">There is a lesson in this. We are born into a bloodline, yes - but we need not be bound by it.</content>
  <content contentuid="h5382d1degbdc3g4b51ga10ag263388083f9b" version="3">I'd like to know your thoughts on our companions.</content>
  <content contentuid="h7087017dg039eg48e4gbb36g844d20a7db1c" version="3">Oh, the tiny puny elf with leaves in his hair, and dirt under his fingernails.</content>
  <content contentuid="h4aaf8997gd09dg4616g8982g7c2f17ec188b" version="3">Boo speaks sense, as ever. There is goodness in Wyll - we have seen it. </content>
  <content contentuid="ha94deb13g2a74g4b58gb5b4g7d19fbd2e862" version="3">Hm. So... duty, camaraderie, help in troubled times - what I call the bond of a wychlaran, you simply call... friendship?</content>
  <content contentuid="h479afa53g1102g4807ga42fgd15f5e779213" version="3">Gortash sold her to Zariel. He had a lot to answer for.</content>
  <content contentuid="hc9924824gbc8bg42d6g846agd6aa9fbb3a7e" version="3">The problem with one so gazing of their navel, however - they are easily ambushed. Brigands split my skull like a sodden wine-skin.</content>
  <content contentuid="h65cb2a90g0bd2g4f29g8f4cg918e759861c9" version="3">When Sarevok's butt had been kicked so hard that we thought he would never return, we settled in Baldur's Gate for a while.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9245ea73g68dfg4a9fg9bd9ge1719e0c9dcd" version="3">That's nothing to do with being a wychlaran - it's just called being a friend.</content>
  <content contentuid="h09e3cae2g3b5dg453ag81ceg7d3500559edb" version="3">The mind of Minsc was occupied with important matters. I was browsing at a slum vendor's stall, looking for Boo's favourite nuts.</content>
  <content contentuid="h40d033ddgc569g4aa4gb887g08700c7d145b" version="3">That is what I remember, more than any battles against Bhaal and his spawn.</content>

  <content contentuid="hdc9f8feag64f1g4017ga119g76e76e235771" version="3">Did he take a bath in the River Styx and temporarily forget himself? I do not remember.</content>
  <content contentuid="h0ccb32f2g84d2g4c3eg9dedgf050663e4edb" version="3">You should give him a break - he's only trying to help.</content>
  <content contentuid="h9890d581g7127g4703g9f07g7c99c3f7833d" version="3">Hah, you think &lt;i&gt;we&lt;/i&gt; are the prey? Our warriors only stopped hoarding your hides because they made for such poor leather. </content>
  <content contentuid="h7bb27f43ga3f5g4d4cgb01fg863f68b6084c" version="3">&lt;i&gt;Speak of something else.&lt;/i&gt;</content>

  <content contentuid="h14651ce0g949dg45e4ga91fge0f1fed41bdb" version="3">You clearly care for one another - so enough of the arguing.</content>
  <content contentuid="h1ed7d76cgce20g4ec0g8445gc99415c05fad" version="3">GALE! MY GOOD FRIEND! WHERE ARE YOU? MINSC AND BOO WOULD LIKE TO HEAR ABOUT THE EXPLODING.</content>
  <content contentuid="hdcff2ac8g48a1g49f9g8737gb18d163800ae" version="3">But Minsc, of course, will translate.</content>
  <content contentuid="hf015f578g80a9g4ba8g9746g4a378ab7f474" version="3">This is so in Rashemen - but not beyond her borders. Here, the spirits sleep - and perhaps we ought to be glad of this.</content>
  <content contentuid="hfc1f3dd9gbafdg46adg94cfgcf58f66a9807" version="3">Thank you. It's nice not having to justify myself for once.</content>
  <content contentuid="h95e0239bg4083g4125g8325g8e1959d96e4c" version="3">Aha! Perhaps this is the reason, Boo. It is not because of the legendary thickness of my skull.</content>
  <content contentuid="h51a4651eg4fe8g44aegae35g7de624ca70e9" version="3">What was it like being a statue?</content>
